### 3. Operation-Specific Contexts

#### Status Check Operations
- **Keywords**: ["status", "progress", "phase", "state", "completion"]
- **Topics**: ["tracking", "monitoring", "progress", "workflow"]
- **Required Sections**: ["status", "progress", "phase"]
- **Excluded Sections**: ["implementation", "detailed", "examples"]
- **Strategy**: Minimal chunks (1-2 for most operations)

#### Implementation Operations
- **Keywords**: ["function", "class", "implement", "code", "algorithm"]
- **Topics**: ["implementation", "development", "coding", "logic"]
- **Required Sections**: ["implementation", "core", "function", "class"]
- **Excluded Sections**: ["examples", "documentation", "overview"]
- **Strategy**: Expanded chunks (4-10 for complex operations)

#### Configuration Operations
- **Keywords**: ["config", "settings", "options", "parameters"]
- **Topics**: ["configuration", "setup", "initialization"]
- **Required Sections**: ["config", "settings", "initialization"]
- **Strategy**: Focused chunks (2-4 for configuration access)

### 4. Progressive Loading System

#### Loading Stages
1. **Initial Load**: 2-4 most relevant chunks based on operation context
2. **Progressive Expansion**: Add 1-2 more chunks when additional context needed
3. **Maximum Chunks**: Cap at 4-10 chunks depending on operation complexity

#### Expansion Triggers
- **Insufficient Context**: When initial chunks provide less than 1000 characters
- **Operation Requirements**: When operation explicitly requires expanded context
- **User Request**: When user needs more comprehensive information

### 5. Relevance Scoring Algorithm

#### Scoring Components
1. **Keyword Matching (30% weight)**: Match chunk keywords against operation keywords
2. **Topic Matching (25% weight)**: Match chunk topics against operation topics
3. **Section Relevance (30% weight)**: Match section titles against required/excluded sections
4. **Content Type (15% weight)**: Match content type against operation requirements

#### Scoring Calculation
- **Keyword Score**: (matched keywords / total keywords) * 0.3
- **Topic Score**: (matched topics / total topics) * 0.25
- **Section Score**: Base 0.5 + bonus for required sections - penalty for excluded sections
- **Content Score**: Bonus for relevant content types (code, YAML, documentation)
- **Final Score**: Sum of all components, normalized to 0-1 range

### 6. Integration with Existing Systems

#### Session Cache Integration
- **Enhanced Cache Keys**: Include operation context in cache keys
- **Chunking Threshold**: Files >25KB automatically use chunking
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful fallback to full content when chunking fails
- **Metadata Storage**: Store chunking information in cache entries

#### Selective YAML Parser Integration
- **Combined Optimization**: Chunking + selective parsing for maximum reduction
- **YAML-Specific Boundaries**: Specialized boundary detection for YAML files
- **Field-Level Optimization**: Chunk based on YAML structure and required fields

#### Lazy Loading Integration
- **Module Chunking**: Large behavioral modules loaded in chunks
- **Progressive Module Loading**: Load core components first, expand as needed
- **Component Extraction**: Extract specific components from chunked content

#### Workflow Integration
- **Assignment Reading**: Enhanced read_assignment() with chunking support
- **Work Discovery**: Optimized scanning with chunked content processing
- **Behavioral Loading**: Force-load patterns with intelligent chunking
