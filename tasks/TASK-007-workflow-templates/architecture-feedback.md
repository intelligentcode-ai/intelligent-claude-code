# Architecture Review Feedback

## Review by @AI-Architect

### Overall Assessment
The workflow template design is sound and aligns well with the goal of replacing complex behavioral enforcement with structured, file-based workflows. The emphasis on Knowledge Retrieval/Generation is properly positioned.

### Architectural Approvals

✅ **Template Structure** - YAML is the right choice for readability and tooling
✅ **Hook Architecture** - Clean integration points without over-engineering  
✅ **Knowledge Integration** - First/last positioning ensures learning culture
✅ **Fail-Safe Design** - Invalid customizations won't break core functionality

### Specific Feedback on Concerns

#### 1. Complexity Balance
The hook system strikes a good balance. Keep the number of hooks limited to the 5 proposed to avoid complexity creep.

#### 2. Extension Safety  
Recommend implementing these safeguards:
- Validate extensions against a schema during PLAN phase
- Limit override depth to prevent complete workflow replacement
- Require explicit `allow_override: true` on steps that can be replaced

#### 3. Version Management
- Use semantic versioning for templates (e.g., 1.0.0)
- Templates should declare minimum version compatibility
- Assignment files should record which template version was used

#### 4. Performance
Conditional logic evaluation is negligible. Keep conditions simple (property checks only, no complex expressions).

#### 5. Security
- Sanitize all template inputs
- No arbitrary code execution in templates
- Validate file paths and external references

### Architectural Decisions

#### On Your Questions:

1. **YAML Anchors**: YES - Support them for DRY templates but document clearly
2. **Validation Tool**: YES - Critical for safety. Implement as part of PLAN phase
3. **Async Hooks**: NO - Keep it simple. Synchronous execution is sufficient
4. **Inheritance Depth**: Single level only to maintain clarity
5. **Hook Versioning**: NO - Version the entire template. Hooks are part of the contract

### Additional Requirements

1. **Template Discovery**: Templates should be discoverable with metadata about their purpose
2. **Composition**: Support including partial workflows (e.g., `include: security-checks.yaml`)
3. **Defaults**: Provide sensible defaults that work without customization
4. **Diagnostics**: Clear error messages when template processing fails

### Approved Design Elements

```yaml
# Example showing approved patterns
workflow:
  version: "1.0.0"
  min_compatible: "1.0.0"
  
  # Knowledge phases - approved positioning
  phases:
    - knowledge_retrieval  # First
    - planning_activities  # Middle
    - knowledge_generation # Last
    
  # Limited, well-defined hooks - approved
  hooks:
    pre_planning: {}
    post_requirements: {}
    pre_execution: {}
    post_implementation: {}
    pre_deployment: {}
    
  # Simple conditions - approved
  conditional_steps:
    - condition: "config.security_validation"  # Simple property check
      steps: [...]
```

### Final Recommendation
APPROVED with the above considerations. The design successfully transforms behavioral complexity into structural simplicity while maintaining flexibility.

Proceed to EXECUTE phase with this design.
