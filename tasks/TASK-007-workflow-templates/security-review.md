# Security Review - TASK-007

**Reviewer:** @Security-Engineer  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 09:02:00  
**Component:** Workflow Templates

## Security Assessment

### 1. Input Validation ✅
- Templates use YAML which has built-in syntax validation
- No arbitrary code execution in templates
- Conditions limited to simple property checks

### 2. Injection Prevention ✅
- No string interpolation in critical paths
- Git operations properly sanitize with sed commands
- Forbidden terms list prevents sensitive data in commits

### 3. Access Control ⚠️
- Templates don't define permission models
- Recommendation: Add role-based access to hooks (follow-up task)

### 4. Secrets Management ✅
- No secrets stored in templates
- Git privacy mode strips sensitive terms
- Validation includes "No secrets in code" check

### 5. External Integration Security ✅
- Integration points well-defined
- No direct system access
- Sandbox execution mentioned for custom code

### 6. Data Privacy ✅
- Knowledge generation respects privacy
- Embedded config doesn't expose sensitive data
- GDPR compliance example provided

## Security Findings

### ✅ Positive Findings
1. **Fail-Safe Design**: Invalid customizations don't break core flow
2. **Input Sanitization**: Git operations include sanitization  
3. **No Code Execution**: Templates are declarative only
4. **Privacy Controls**: Git privacy mode properly implemented

### ⚠️ Minor Concerns (Non-Blocking)
1. **Access Control**: No permission model for who can customize workflows
2. **Audit Trail**: Limited logging of workflow customizations
3. **External Hook Validation**: External integrations need credential validation

## Recommendations

Creating follow-up task for access control enhancement:
- TASK-007-fix-access-control: Add role-based permissions to workflow customizations

## Security Verdict: APPROVED

The workflow templates are secure by design with proper input validation and no code execution risks. The minor concerns are addressable in follow-up tasks without blocking current implementation.
