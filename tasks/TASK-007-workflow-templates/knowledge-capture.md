# Knowledge Capture - TASK-007

**Task:** Define workflow process templates  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 09:03:00  
**Team:** @AI-Engineer, @AI-Architect, @Security-Engineer

## What We Learned

### 1. Workflow Structure Design
- **Knowledge phases must bookend workflows**: Retrieval first, Generation last
- **Hooks provide sufficient flexibility**: 5 well-placed hooks cover most needs
- **YAML format works well**: Human-readable and tool-friendly

### 2. Configuration-Driven Behavior
- **Embedded config eliminates runtime lookups**: All settings in assignment file
- **Conditional logic stays simple**: Property checks only, no complex expressions
- **blocking_enabled is critical**: Drives review workflow behavior

### 3. Integration Patterns
- **Three customization methods suffice**:
  - Direct injection for simple additions
  - Process override for replacements
  - Process extension for enhancements
- **Hook timing matters**: Clear documentation prevents confusion

### 4. Simplification Success
- **Structure enforces behavior**: No complex behavioral prompts needed
- **File-based approach works**: Assignment files contain everything
- **80% context reduction achievable**: Lean templates replace bloated behaviors

## Reusable Patterns

### Pattern 1: Knowledge-Centric Workflow
```yaml
phases:
  - knowledge_retrieval  # Always first
  - core_activities      # Domain-specific
  - knowledge_generation # Always last
```

### Pattern 2: Config-Driven Conditionals
```yaml
conditional:
  - condition: "embedded_config.property == value"
    action: "specific_behavior"
```

### Pattern 3: Non-Blocking Reviews
```yaml
review_findings:
  if_blocking_false:
    action: "CREATE_FOLLOWUP_TASK"
    continue: true
```

## Challenges Faced

1. **Balancing flexibility vs simplicity**: Resolved by limiting hooks to 5
2. **Version compatibility**: Addressed with semantic versioning
3. **Error handling gaps**: Created follow-up task for documentation

## Recommendations for Future

1. **Start with standard templates**: Customize only when needed
2. **Keep conditions simple**: Avoid complex logic in templates
3. **Document customizations**: Always explain why customizing
4. **Test integration early**: Validate workflow changes first

## Metrics

- Planning time: 15 minutes (knowledge retrieval helped)
- Implementation time: 10 minutes (clear design accelerated)
- Review findings: 5 non-blocking (good for first iteration)
- Context reduction: Estimated 80% when fully deployed

## Memory Entity Creation

Creating entity for future reference:
- Type: "WorkflowDesign"
- Name: "Lean-Workflow-Templates-2025-07-15"
- Observations:
  - "Knowledge phases bookend all workflows"
  - "5 hooks provide sufficient customization"
  - "Config-driven behavior eliminates runtime lookups"
  - "YAML templates are self-documenting"
  - "Non-blocking reviews create follow-up tasks"
