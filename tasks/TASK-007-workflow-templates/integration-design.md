# Workflow Integration Points Design

## Overview
Integration points allow workflows to be customized for specific project needs while maintaining the core structure. The design prioritizes simplicity and clear extension mechanisms.

## Integration Architecture

### 1. Hook-Based Integration
Workflows define specific hook points where custom logic can be inserted:

```yaml
hooks:
  pre_planning:
    description: "Before any planning activities begin"
    inputs: ["task_description", "user_context"]
    outputs: ["additional_requirements", "constraints"]
    
  post_requirements:
    description: "After requirements are gathered"
    inputs: ["requirements", "acceptance_criteria"]
    outputs: ["enhanced_requirements", "additional_criteria"]
    
  pre_execution:
    description: "Before implementation starts"
    inputs: ["task_assignment", "subtasks"]
    outputs: ["environment_setup", "preconditions"]
    
  post_implementation:
    description: "After code is complete"
    inputs: ["implementation_artifacts", "code_changes"]
    outputs: ["validation_results", "additional_artifacts"]
    
  pre_deployment:
    description: "Before release/deployment"
    inputs: ["validated_artifacts", "deployment_config"]
    outputs: ["approval_status", "deployment_readiness"]
```

### 2. User Requirements Integration

#### Method 1: Direct Injection
Users can provide requirements that are directly injected into the workflow:

```yaml
user_requirements:
  iac_specifications:
    inject_at: "post_requirements"
    content:
      - "All infrastructure must be defined as code"
      - "Use Terraform for AWS resources"
      - "Environment parity required"
      
  testing_requirements:
    inject_at: "pre_execution"
    content:
      - "Minimum 80% code coverage"
      - "Integration tests for all APIs"
      - "Performance benchmarks required"
```

#### Method 2: Process Override
Users can override entire workflow sections:

```yaml
process_overrides:
  replace_validation:
    replaces: "standard_validation"
    with:
      - "Run security scan with custom rules"
      - "Execute performance test suite"
      - "Validate against compliance checklist"
```

#### Method 3: Process Extension
Users can extend existing processes:

```yaml
process_extensions:
  extend_planning:
    extends: "architecture_design"
    add_steps:
      - "Review with security team"
      - "Cost estimation analysis"
      - "Scalability assessment"
```

### 3. Config-Driven Customization

Workflows can adapt based on embedded_config values:

```yaml
conditional_steps:
  - id: "security-validation"
    condition: "embedded_config.security_validation == true"
    steps:
      - "Run SAST scan"
      - "Check dependencies"
      - "Validate secrets handling"
      
  - id: "performance-testing"
    condition: "embedded_config.testing_approach == 'comprehensive'"
    steps:
      - "Load testing"
      - "Stress testing"
      - "Benchmark comparison"
```

### 4. External System Integration

#### JIRA Integration Points:
```yaml
external_integrations:
  jira:
    sync_points:
      - hook: "post_planning"
        action: "create_jira_issue"
        mapping:
          task_id: "issue_key"
          acceptance_criteria: "custom_field_10001"
          
      - hook: "phase_transition"
        action: "update_jira_status"
        mapping:
          PLAN: "To Do"
          EXECUTE: "In Progress"
          ACCEPTANCE: "In Review"
          DONE: "Done"
```

#### CI/CD Integration Points:
```yaml
external_integrations:
  ci_cd:
    sync_points:
      - hook: "post_implementation"
        action: "trigger_pipeline"
        parameters:
          branch: "{{git_branch}}"
          tests: "{{test_suite}}"
          
      - hook: "acceptance_complete"
        action: "gate_deployment"
        conditions:
          all_tests_pass: true
          security_scan_clean: true
```

### 5. Knowledge System Integration

#### Memory Integration:
```yaml
knowledge_integration:
  retrieval:
    sources:
      - "mcp_memory"
      - "file_based_memory"
    queries:
      - "similar_tasks"
      - "past_solutions"
      - "learned_patterns"
      
  generation:
    capture:
      - "approach_taken"
      - "challenges_faced"
      - "solutions_found"
    storage:
      entity_type: "TaskExecution"
      relations: ["implements", "solves", "learned_from"]
```

### 6. Validation and Safety

#### Integration Validation:
```yaml
integration_validation:
  required_checks:
    - "Hook compatibility verification"
    - "Input/output contract validation"
    - "Circular dependency detection"
    - "Permission verification"
    
  safety_measures:
    - "Sandbox execution for custom code"
    - "Timeout limits on integrations"
    - "Rollback capability"
    - "Audit logging of all integrations"
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Keep It Simple**: Integration points should be obvious and well-documented
2. **Fail Safe**: Invalid integrations should not break the core workflow
3. **Validate Early**: Check integration compatibility during PLAN phase
4. **Document Clearly**: Each integration point needs clear documentation
5. **Version Carefully**: Maintain compatibility across workflow versions
