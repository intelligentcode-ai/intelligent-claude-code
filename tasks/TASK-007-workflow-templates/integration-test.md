# Workflow Integration Test Report

**Tester:** @AI-Engineer  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 09:01:00  
**Component:** Workflow Templates

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Template Reference ✅
Tested referencing templates from assignment files:
```yaml
workflow:
  planning: "workflow-templates/outer-workflow.yaml"
  execution: "workflow-templates/inner-workflow.yaml"
```
**Result:** Templates load correctly, phases defined properly

### 2. Hook Integration ✅
Tested hook-based customization:
```yaml
customizations:
  post_requirements:
    - "Custom security review"
```
**Result:** Hooks execute at correct timing, customizations applied

### 3. Conditional Logic ✅
Tested config-driven behavior:
```yaml
# With blocking_enabled = false
review_findings:
  if_blocking_false:
    action: "CREATE_FOLLOWUP_TASK"
```
**Result:** Conditional logic evaluates correctly based on embedded_config

### 4. Knowledge Phase Positioning ✅
Verified knowledge retrieval/generation:
- Outer workflow: Knowledge Retrieval (first) → Planning → Knowledge Generation (last)
- Inner workflow: Knowledge Retrieval (first) → Execution → Knowledge Generation (last)
**Result:** Phases correctly positioned

### 5. Example Customizations ✅
Tested IaC and testing customization examples:
- IaC customization adds infrastructure-specific steps
- Testing customization enhances validation phases
**Result:** Examples work as documented

### 6. Integration Points ✅
Verified all 5 hooks are accessible:
- pre_planning
- post_requirements  
- pre_execution
- post_implementation
- pre_deployment
**Result:** All hooks available and functional

## Test Summary

| Test Area | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Template Loading | ✅ PASS | Templates parse correctly |
| Hook Execution | ✅ PASS | Hooks trigger at right time |
| Conditional Logic | ✅ PASS | Config drives behavior |
| Knowledge Phases | ✅ PASS | First/last positioning correct |
| Customization | ✅ PASS | Examples work |
| Documentation | ✅ PASS | Clear integration guide |

## Conclusion

The workflow templates integrate successfully with the assignment file system. The structure enforces behavior through configuration rather than complex behavioral prompts, achieving the simplification goal.
