# Workflow Templates Architecture Review

## Summary for @AI-Architect

### Design Overview
We are creating two workflow templates that define:
1. **Outer Workflow**: How planning artifacts (epics/stories/tasks) are created
2. **Inner Workflow**: How individual tasks are executed

Both workflows incorporate Knowledge Retrieval as the first step and Knowledge Generation as the last step, as requested by the user.

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. Template Structure
- YAML format for human readability and tooling support
- Clear metadata and versioning
- Inheritance support for customization
- Hook-based integration architecture

#### 2. Integration Architecture
- **Pre-defined Hooks**: Strategic points for customization
- **Three Integration Methods**:
  - Direct injection of requirements
  - Process override for full replacement
  - Process extension for additions
- **Config-driven conditional logic**

#### 3. Knowledge Integration
- First step: Retrieve relevant past knowledge
- Last step: Generate new knowledge from execution
- MCP Memory integration with file-based fallback

#### 4. Safety and Validation
- Hook compatibility verification
- Input/output contract validation
- Circular dependency detection
- Fail-safe design (invalid integrations don't break core)

### Architecture Concerns for Review

1. **Complexity Balance**: Is the hook system simple enough while being powerful?
2. **Extension Safety**: Are the override/extend mechanisms safe from breaking core workflows?
3. **Version Management**: How do we handle template version compatibility?
4. **Performance**: Will conditional logic evaluation impact execution speed?
5. **Security**: Are the integration points secure against injection attacks?

### Proposed File Structure
```
workflow-templates/
├── README.md
├── outer-workflow.yaml    # Planning process template
├── inner-workflow.yaml    # Execution process template
├── examples/
│   ├── iac-customization.yaml
│   └── testing-customization.yaml
└── schemas/
    └── workflow-schema.yaml  # Validation schema
```

### Questions for Architecture Review

1. Should we support YAML anchors/references for DRY templates?
2. Do we need a template validation tool/command?
3. Should hooks support async execution?
4. How deep should inheritance go (single level or multiple)?
5. Should we version the hook interface separately?

### Recommendation
The design prioritizes:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and use
- **Flexibility**: Extensive customization options
- **Safety**: Fail-safe integration mechanisms
- **Maintainability**: Clear structure and documentation

Please review and provide feedback on the architectural approach.
