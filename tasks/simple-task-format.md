# Simple Task Format for Users

Just drop your ideas, bugs, or enhancements as simple markdown files in the `pending/` folder.

## Format

```markdown
# Short title

Brief description of what you want
```

That's it! The Project Manager persona will:
- Analyze complexity and impact
- **Estimate realistic effort** (AI-honest assessment)
- Assign appropriate priority
- Identify required personas
- Create detailed requirements
- Generate acceptance criteria
- Add technical context
- Track progress

## Why PM Estimates Effort

In this AI-agentic system, the PM persona estimates effort because:
- **It's more honest** - AI knows its own capabilities
- **It's consistent** - Same estimation methodology 
- **It's realistic** - Based on actual AI performance
- **It's transparent** - You see true AI estimates

## Examples

### Bug Report
```markdown
# Login bug with special characters

Users reporting they can't login when password contains @ or # symbols
```

### Feature Idea
```markdown
# Dark mode toggle

Would be nice to have a dark mode option in settings
```

### Enhancement
```markdown
# Speed up search

Search is taking 3-5 seconds, need to optimize the database queries
```

## Tips
- Keep it simple - just describe what you want
- Don't worry about technical details
- No need for metadata or formatting
- The PM will refine and organize everything
- You'll see the PM's honest effort estimates
