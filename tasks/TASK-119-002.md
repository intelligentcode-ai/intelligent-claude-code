# [AI-Architect] Implement subagent instruction focusing patterns

**ID:** TASK-119-002
**Bug:** BUG-119
**Status:** PLANNED
**Assigned:** @AI-Architect
**Priority:** P0

## Description
Create patterns for ultra-focused subagent instructions that eliminate unnecessary file reading and analysis.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design "surgical instruction" pattern with exact work scope
- [ ] Create "no-read-needed" pattern when parent provides all context
- [ ] Develop "line-specific" pattern for targeted file operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- Subagents never read files unless absolutely necessary
- Instructions include all needed context inline
- Pattern shows clear before/after token usage
- Zero redundant analysis between parent and subagent

## Technical Notes
- Include anti-patterns to avoid
- Show how to pass analysis results, not raw data
- Focus on behavioral efficiency
