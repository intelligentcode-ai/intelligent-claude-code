problem_description: |
  The enhanced planning system needs to read and process ALL settings from
  config.md during the PLAN phase, embedding them into assignment files to
  create self-contained tasks. Currently missing:
  - Config processing during planning
  - Embedded settings in assignment files
  - Review findings workflow based on blocking_enabled
  - Git privacy enforcement from config
