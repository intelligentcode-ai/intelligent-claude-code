# First Task Using Enhanced Planning System
task:
  id: "TASK-001"
  title: "Implement Enhanced Planning Mode"
  type: "feature"
  epic: "EPIC-ENFORCEMENT"
  created: "2025-01-14 10:30:00"
  phase: "EXECUTE"
  
problem_description: |
  The current behavioral enforcement system relies on weak prompting that can be
  bypassed, leading to role assignment errors and process violations. We need a
  structured workflow system that provides explicit task assignments with clear
  acceptance criteria, ensuring end-to-end reliability while maintaining natural
  language interaction.
