# [AI-Architect] Create efficient subagent handoff patterns

**ID:** TASK-119-001
**Bug:** BUG-119
**Status:** PLANNED
**Assigned:** @AI-Architect
**Priority:** P0

## Description
Design behavioral patterns for efficient parent-to-subagent handoffs that minimize token usage through focused context passing.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create pattern for parent to extract and pass only relevant file sections
- [ ] Design focused instruction format that prevents re-analysis
- [ ] Define context handoff structure with specific line numbers/sections

## Acceptance Criteria
- Parent extracts relevant sections before subagent creation
- Subagent receives pre-analyzed context, not raw files
- Clear pattern shows 80% token reduction
- Pattern prevents subagent file reading when unnecessary

## Technical Notes
- Focus on behavioral patterns, not code
- Use "context capsule" concept for handoffs
- Include examples of good vs bad handoffs
