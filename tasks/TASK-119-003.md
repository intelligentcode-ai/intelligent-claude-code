# [AI-Architect] Add token-aware workflow optimizations

**ID:** TASK-119-003
**Bug:** BUG-119
**Status:** PLANNED
**Assigned:** @AI-Architect
**Priority:** P0

## Description
Enhance executable-workflow.md with token-efficient patterns for all subagent operations.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Add "Token-Efficient Subagent Creation" section to workflow
- [ ] Update inner/outer workflow with context handoff points
- [ ] Create examples of token-optimized Task.create() calls

## Acceptance Criteria
- Workflow explicitly shows how to minimize tokens
- Every subagent example includes focused context
- Clear patterns for "what parent analyzes" vs "what subagent does"
- Token usage guidance integrated throughout

## Technical Notes
- Update existing workflow, don't create new files
- Show concrete examples with token counts
- Emphasize behavioral efficiency over completeness
