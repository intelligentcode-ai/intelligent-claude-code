# [Developer] Remove redundant git operation commands

**ID:** TASK-005
**Bug:** BUG-117
**Status:** PLANNED
**Assigned:** @Developer
**Priority:** P0

## Description
Remove git commands that duplicate functionality. The executable-workflow.md already contains complete git operation logic with settings awareness.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Delete /icc-git-validate command (functionality within icc-git-operation)
- [ ] Keep /icc-git-operation as the primary git interface
- [ ] Keep /icc-git-clean for repository cleanup
- [ ] Update any git operation references
- [ ] Test git privacy mode and branch protection

## Commands to Remove
- `src/commands/icc-git-validate.md` (validation is part of git-operation)

## Keep These
- `src/commands/icc-git-operation.md` (primary git interface)
- `src/commands/icc-git-clean.md` (unique cleanup functionality)

## Behaviors to Remove
- `src/behaviors/git-privacy-enforcer.md` (functionality in executable-workflow.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Redundant git commands removed
- Git operations continue through icc-git-operation
- Git privacy settings respected
- Branch protection continues to work

## Technical Notes
- Executable-workflow.md has complete git logic with settings
- Git privacy strips AI mentions when enabled
- Branch protection enforces feature branches
