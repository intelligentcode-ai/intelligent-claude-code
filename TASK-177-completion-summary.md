# TASK-177: Implement Mandatory Subtask Execution - COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully implemented mandatory subtask execution patterns in the lean-workflow-executor.md file to enforce that all non-PM tasks MUST use Claude Code's Task tool for execution.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Mandatory Subtask Delegation Pattern
- Added `executeTask()` function that enforces Task tool usage for all non-PM roles
- Created `delegateToSubtask()` function that wraps all task execution in Task tool calls
- Implemented `formatSubtaskDescription()` to include all context in subtask descriptions

### 2. PM Delegation Enhancement
- Updated story planning to include `delegateTasksInParallel()` function
- Added `identifyParallelGroups()` to detect tasks that can run simultaneously
- Implemented `canExecuteInParallel()` to determine which tasks are safe to parallelize

### 3. Task Tool Enforcement
- Added enforcement in role detection integration
- Created monitoring functions to detect direct execution violations
- Implemented learning entry creation for Task tool violations
- Added automatic forced delegation when violations detected

### 4. Key Features Implemented

#### Mandatory Enforcement
```pseudocode
IF currentRole != "PM":
    // Specialists MUST delegate to subtask
    RETURN delegateToSubtask(task, currentRole)
```

#### Subtask Context
- Role name included in task description
- Task file path passed to subtask
- Embedded config respected and passed through
- Clear actions specified for subtask execution

#### Parallel Detection
- PM identifies parallel task groups automatically
- Non-conflicting tasks delegated simultaneously
- Blocking and critical path tasks handled sequentially

#### Violation Handling
- Learning entries created for violations
- Warnings logged for improper Task tool usage
- Automatic forced delegation when violations detected

## Benefits

1. **Enforces Best Practices**: All specialists must use Task tool, no exceptions
2. **Enables Parallelism**: PM can delegate multiple tasks simultaneously
3. **Maintains Context**: All task context properly passed to subtasks
4. **Learning Integration**: Violations captured as learning entries
5. **No New Architecture**: Uses existing Claude Code Task tool

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test specialist task execution to verify Task tool usage
2. Verify PM can delegate parallel tasks simultaneously
3. Check that violations create learning entries
4. Ensure embedded config is properly passed through

## Status

âœ… **COMPLETED** - All requirements implemented successfully
