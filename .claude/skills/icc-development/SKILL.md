# ICC Framework Development Guide

This skill provides guidance for contributing to the Intelligent Claude Code framework itself.

## Project Structure

```
intelligent-claude-code/
├── src/
│   ├── skills/          # Distributed skills (main source)
│   ├── hooks/           # Claude Code hooks (enforcement)
│   ├── behaviors/       # Behavioral guidance files
│   └── ...
├── .claude/
│   └── skills/          # Local project skills (symlinks + dev tools)
├── docs/                # Documentation
├── install/             # Installation scripts
└── CLAUDE.md            # Project entry point
```

## Key Principle

**This project IS the ICC framework source.**

- Changes to `src/skills/` affect what users install
- Changes to `src/hooks/` affect enforcement rules
- Local `.claude/skills/` contains symlinks for testing

## Creating New Skills

### Location
- **Distributed skills**: `src/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- **Project-local skills**: `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

### Skill Structure
```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description for skill matching. Include trigger phrases.
---

# Skill Title

Content with sections, examples, and guidance.
```

### Testing Skills Locally

**Setup symlinks** (once per clone):
```bash
cd .claude/skills
ln -sf ../../src/skills/commit-pr commit-pr
ln -sf ../../src/skills/git-privacy git-privacy
# Add more symlinks as needed for skills being developed
```

**Workflow:**
1. Create/modify skill in `src/skills/`
2. Add symlink in `.claude/skills/` if new skill
3. Test with `/skill-name` invocation
4. Commit changes to `src/skills/` (source)

## Modifying Hooks

### Location
`src/hooks/*.js`

### Key Hooks
- `git-enforcement.js` - Branch protection, privacy filtering
- `summary-file-enforcement.js` - File placement rules
- `agent-infrastructure-protection.js` - System file protection

### Testing Hooks
Hooks are installed to `~/.claude/hooks/` during installation.
For local testing, manually copy or symlink.

## Adding Behaviors

### Location
`src/behaviors/*.md`

### Guidelines
- Behaviors are always-active structural rules
- Keep minimal - use skills for conditional guidance
- Import in CLAUDE.md with `@./path/to/behavior.md`

## Rollout Process

1. **Develop**: Make changes in `src/`
2. **Test locally**: Use symlinks in `.claude/skills/`
3. **Commit**: Follow conventional commit format
4. **PR**: Create PR for review
5. **Release**: Merge triggers installation update

## Do NOT

- Modify `~/.claude/skills/` directly (that's installed location)
- Commit to main branch directly
- Add AI attribution (git-privacy enforced)
- Create overly broad hooks that block legitimate work

## Naming Conventions

- Skills: `lowercase-hyphenated`
- Hooks: `lowercase-hyphenated.js`
- Behaviors: `lowercase-hyphenated.md`
- Commit types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, style, perf
