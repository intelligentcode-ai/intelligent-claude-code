# GitOps Practices

**Type:** operations
**Applies To:** medium, large, mega
**Keywords:** gitops, deployment, infrastructure, automation, version control

## Description

GitOps methodology for infrastructure and application deployment using Git as the single source of truth.

## Implementation

### Git as Source of Truth
- All infrastructure and application configs in version control
- Declarative configuration management
- Environment promotion through git workflows
- Audit trail through git history

### Automated Deployment Pipeline
- Changes trigger automated deployment workflows
- Rollback capabilities through git revert
- Environment consistency through identical configs
- No manual deployment interventions

### Pull-Based Deployment
- Deployment agents pull changes from git
- Self-healing through continuous reconciliation
- Reduced attack surface (no push credentials)
- Environment isolation and security

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All infrastructure defined as code in version control
- [ ] Automated deployment pipelines configured
- [ ] Environment promotion strategy defined
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested and documented
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting for deployment status
- [ ] Security scanning integrated in pipeline

## Examples

### GitOps Workflow Structure
```yaml
# deployment/production/app-config.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: production
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: my-app:v1.2.3
```

### Branch Strategy
- `main` → Production environment
- `staging` → Staging environment  
- `develop` → Development environment
