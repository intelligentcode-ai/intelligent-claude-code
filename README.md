## What You Get

### ðŸ¤– Agent-Driven Architecture
Complete virtual development team with 14+ specialized agent roles that work together autonomously. Each agent has deep domain expertise and behavioral patterns optimized for their specialty.

### ðŸŽ¯ PRB-Driven Execution
Self-contained blueprints replace complex workflows. Each PRB includes everything needed for single-pass execution: context, standards, examples, validation, and automatic agent invocation. PRBs automatically identify the appropriate specialist agent and execute via Task tool for complete isolation and quality assurance.

### ðŸ‘¥ 14+ Specialist Agent Roles  
**Core Agents:**
- @PM, @Architect, @Developer, @AI-Engineer
- @System-Engineer, @DevOps-Engineer, @Database-Engineer
- @Security-Engineer, @QA-Engineer, @Backend-Tester
- @Requirements-Engineer, @Web-Designer, @User-Role

**Dynamic Agent Creation:**
- Unlimited specialists for any technology (@React-Developer, @AWS-Engineer, @ML-Specialist)
- Domain experts created automatically based on project needs
- All agents have 10+ years of expertise in their specialization

### ðŸ§  Self-Learning Agent System
- Agent execution generates learnings automatically
- Successful patterns captured and shared between agents
- Agents apply previous learnings to new tasks
- Continuous improvement through cross-agent knowledge sharing

### ðŸ§  Memory-First Operations
- All agent operations check memory before action
- Automatic pattern capture and storage across agent interactions
- Memory pattern application tracking
- Version-controlled in memory/ directory
- Topic-based organization with auto-pruning

### ðŸ“‹ Dynamic Best-Practices Injection
- Add methodological approaches to `best-practices/` directory
- Auto-discovery during PRB generation and agent coordination
- Support for ANY methodology (GitOps, DevSecOps, TDD, Clean Architecture, etc.)
- Template placeholders replaced with your project's practices
- Zero system modification required

### âš¡ Autonomous Agent Operation
- **L1**: Manual approval required for all agent actions
- **L2**: Agent coordination with architect approval (default)
- **L3**: Fully autonomous multi-agent execution

### ðŸ”§ Adapts to YOUR Project
Configure in CLAUDE.md where your docs/standards are. Agents find and include them automatically in PRBs and execution patterns.

## How It Works

1. **Request Work** â†’ "@PM Implement OAuth2 login"
2. **Agent Activation** â†’ @PM analyzes and creates specialist agents as needed
3. **Memory Check** â†’ Agents search for existing patterns/learnings
4. **Best-Practices Discovery** â†’ Agents find relevant methodological approaches
5. **Analyze Complexity** â†’ Agent team scores complexity (@PM + @Architect for Large/Mega)
6. **Generate PRB** â†’ Self-contained blueprint with embedded context + practices + agent coordination
7. **Agent Execution** â†’ Multi-agent collaborative implementation
8. **Git Integration** â†’ Auto version bump + commit + push
9. **Cross-Agent Learning** â†’ Capture new patterns shared across agent memory

## Agent-Driven Story Management

Transform natural language stories into executable PRBs with multi-agent coordination:

1. **Story Creation** â†’ Write stories in `stories/` directory
2. **@PM Analysis** â†’ "@PM break down authentication story"
3. **Agent Collaboration** â†’ @PM + @Architect + domain specialists collaborate
4. **PRB Generation** â†’ Ready-to-execute blueprints with agent assignments in `prbs/ready/`
5. **Agent Execution** â†’ Specialized agents execute PRBs collaboratively
6. **Story Selection** â†’ "@PM what story should we work on next?"

### Story Directory Structure
```
stories/
â”œâ”€â”€ user-authentication.md    # Business requirements
â”œâ”€â”€ payment-system.md         # Feature specifications  
â””â”€â”€ drafts/                   # Work-in-progress stories
    â””â”€â”€ api-redesign.md
```

### Multi-Agent Story Process
- **Story Analysis**: @PM reads business goals, specialist agents evaluate technical approaches
- **Agent Team Assembly**: Dynamic creation of domain specialists (@Auth-Engineer, @Frontend-Developer, etc.)
- **Priority Setting**: Multi-agent evaluation of business value + technical complexity
- **PRB Creation**: @PM generates complexity-appropriate PRBs with agent assignments
- **Agent Coordination**: Collaborative execution across specialized agent team
- **Next Selection**: Agent team considers dependencies, risk, current application state

## Automatic PRB System

**Complete Automation Pipeline:** Work requests automatically trigger PRB creation and execution with no manual steps required.

### Automatic PRB Generation
- **Work Detection**: Intelligent recognition of implementation vs information requests
- **Template Selection**: Automatic complexity scoring and template selection (Nanoâ†’Mega)
- **Context Integration**: Complete project context, configuration, and memory patterns embedded
- **Placeholder Resolution**: All configuration values resolved during generation (no runtime lookups)
- **Quality Validation**: Generated PRBs meet all template requirements and validation standards

### Seamless Work Flow
```bash
# Natural Work Requests â†’ Automatic PRB Creation â†’ Subagent Execution
@PM Build a [project]         # Auto-creates project setup PRBs with specialist assignments
@Developer Implement auth     # Auto-generates implementation PRB with complete context
@AI-Engineer optimize system  # Auto-creates optimization PRB with behavioral patterns
"Fix the login bug"          # Auto-detects work intent, creates bug fix PRB
"Setup CI/CD pipeline"       # Auto-creates infrastructure PRB with DevOps specialist
```

**Intelligent Classification:**
- **Work Triggers** (Auto-PRB): implement, create, build, fix, deploy, configure, setup
- **Information Requests** (No PRB): show, explain, what is, status, how does

### Enhanced Automation Features
- **Context Awareness**: Auto-detects project type (CODE/AI-AGENTIC/HYBRID) and adjusts patterns
- **Dependency Analysis**: Auto-identifies prerequisite work and creates sequential PRBs
- **Size Management**: Auto-breakdown of complex work into multiple â‰¤15 point PRBs
- **Role Assignment**: Auto-selects appropriate specialists based on work type and technology domain
- **Memory Integration**: Auto-searches applicable patterns and embeds learnings in PRBs

## Essential Commands (Lean System)

```bash
/icc-init-system              # Initialize virtual team system
/icc-get-setting [key]        # Access configuration values
/icc-search-memory [query]    # Search stored learnings
```

**Everything else is automatic:**
- PRB generation happens on work detection with complete automation
- Specialist creation via technology domain analysis
- Memory storage during PRB execution  
- Story management through @PM natural language

      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-playwright"]
    },
    "custom-api": {
      "command": "node",

## Configuration (CLAUDE.md)

```yaml
# Tell system where YOUR files are
prb_configuration:
  best_practices_paths:
    - "docs/standards/"        # Your location
    - "engineering/patterns/"  # Your location
    
  code_pattern_search:
    paths: ["src/", "lib/"]    # Your code
    
  behavioral_overrides:
    testing_approach: "tdd"    # Your preferences

# Memory configuration - where AI agents store learnings
memory_configuration:
  external_path: "~/claude-memory"    # External memory location
  # Or use project-local (default): "./memory/"
```

## Memory Configuration

The AI agents can store their learnings in different locations:

### Default (Project-Local)
```yaml
# Memory stored in ./memory/ within your project
# No configuration needed - this is the default
```

### External Memory Path
```yaml
# In CLAUDE.md
memory_configuration:
  external_path: "~/claude-memory"     # Home directory
  external_path: "../shared-memory"   # Relative to project
  external_path: "/path/to/memory"    # Absolute path
```

**Benefits of External Memory:**
- **Privacy**: Keep learnings separate from project code
- **Sharing**: Use same memory across multiple projects  
- **Git Integration**: When `.git` exists in memory path, system auto-commits changes
- **Flexibility**: Store anywhere accessible to the AI agents

## Directory Structure

```
your-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ CLAUDE.md                  # Your config

```
