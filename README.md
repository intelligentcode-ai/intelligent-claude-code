## Dual Scoring System

### How It Works
Every team member displays their current scores in real-time:
```bash
@Developer (P: 5.5pts, Q: 4.0pts - Standard): Implementing user authentication
@Architect (P: 12.0pts, Q: 8.5pts - Senior): System design review complete
@PM (P: 25.0pts, Q: 15.0pts - Elite): Project milestone achieved
```

### Scoring Mechanics
- **Professionalism (P):** Process compliance, workflow adherence, delegation protocols
- **Quality (Q):** Implementation success, peer review results, technical excellence
- **States:** Standard (0-9pts), Senior (10-24pts), Elite (25-99pts), Ultra Mega (100pts)
- **Automatic Tracking:** Every operation updates scores based on evidence

### Real-Time Learning
```bash
LEARNING: @Developer improved by following complete testing workflow
ACHIEVEMENT: @Architect reached Senior level!
TEAM INSIGHT: Proper delegation chains lead to 50% faster delivery
```

### Accountability Features
- **Automatic Replacement:** Team members with -10 professionalism points are replaced
- **Memory Integration:** All scores, achievements, and learning insights are permanently stored
- **Continuous Improvement:** Score changes generate learning callouts and team insights
- **Evidence-Based:** All scoring decisions backed by actual performance data

### Why It Matters
- **Transparency:** Everyone knows exactly where they stand
- **Growth:** Continuous learning insights drive improvement
- **Quality:** High standards maintained through accountability
- **Team Excellence:** Collective improvement through shared achievements

- **Role Delegations**: Strategic analysis layer, complete scope provision, mandatory gates
- **System Changes**: Architecture review, security assessment, performance validation
- **Configuration Changes**: Security validation, compliance checks, proper externalization
- **Testing Activities**: Evidence provision, coverage requirements, validation standards

### Auto-Correction Workflows
- **Quality Issue Detection**: Automatic specialist re-delegation with enhanced scope
- **Knowledge Gap Identification**: Context7 injection or fallback research activation
- **Incomplete Implementation**: PM re-delegation with comprehensive requirements
- **Security Violations**: Security-Engineer intervention with mandatory validation
- **Process Shortcuts**: Immediate correction with proper gate enforcement
- **Assumption-Based Work**: Fact-based validation with evidence requirements

### No Exceptions Policy
- **ALL roles** must follow enforcement protocols
- **ALL activities** require compliance validation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: Context Compacting Recovery

**Claude Code has known context persistence issues.** When Claude Code compacts context or restarts sessions, your virtual team may become unresponsive or fail to switch roles properly.

### üîß **Recovery Solutions**
```bash
@PM refresh
```

**If `@PM refresh` doesn't work:**
```bash
@PM **CHANGE** THE ROLES!
```

**If PM still won't delegate properly:**
```bash
# Emergency role activation sequence
@PM coordinate, @Architect design, @Developer implement. Technical focus, Git workflow, autonomous decisions.
```

**Ultimate fallback:**
```bash
# Exit Claude Code session and restart, then Resume
# This forces complete context reload
```

### üìã **When You Need This**
- Team stops responding to @-notation commands
- **Roles not switching properly** (PM keeps implementing instead of delegating)
- After Claude Code session timeouts or interruptions
- After aggressive context compacting
- Virtual team seems "stuck" or unresponsive

### ‚ö° **Quick Recovery Checklist**
1. `@PM refresh` - Primary recovery method
2. `@PM **CHANGE** THE ROLES!` - Force role switching if refresh fails
3. Emergency role activation sequence if still stuck
4. **Ultimate**: Exit Claude Code ‚Üí Restart ‚Üí Resume session

**üí° Save this command**: Always start troubleshooting with `@PM refresh`

## Troubleshooting

### Team Not Responding?
```bash
# Quick recovery (30 seconds)
@PM refresh                     # Primary solution for context compacting
@PM Status check                # Test if team is active after refresh
```

### GitHub/GitLab Issues?
```bash
@PM git status                  # Check platform and authentication
gh auth login                   # Fix GitHub authentication
glab auth login                 # Fix GitLab authentication
```

### Scoring System Issues?
```bash
@PM: Enforce scoring display for all roles   # Fix missing score displays
@PM: Restore team scores from memory        # Recover lost scores
@PM: Generate team learning summary         # Restart learning system
```
