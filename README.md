# Transform Claude Code into Your Development Team

**One import line. Twelve specialists. Zero compromise.**

Turn Claude Code into an intelligent virtual development team that scales from simple websites to enterprise applications. Get professional Git workflows, autonomous technical decisions, and growing team expertise - all through a single, non-invasive configuration.

## What You Get

üöÄ **12 Expert Roles** - From Requirements Engineer to DevOps, each with deep domain expertise  
‚ö° **Smart Team Scaling** - 6 roles for websites, 12 for enterprise SaaS  
üîÑ **Professional Git Workflow** - Branching, MRs, automated versioning  
üéØ **Direct Communication** - `@Developer fix this bug` `@Architect design this system`  
üìà **Growing Autonomy** - Team learns and handles more over time  
üîó **GitHub + GitLab** - Unified commands work with both platforms

## Quick Start

### Install (30 seconds)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ksamaschke/intelligent-claude-code
cd intelligent-claude-code
make install                  # Local user install
# OR
make install PATH=/project    # Add to specific project
```

**Your project gets one import line:**
```markdown
# Virtual Development Team
@~/.claude/modes/virtual-team.md
```

### Start Building
```bash
@PM Build me a portfolio website with Jekyll
@Architect Design a scalable e-commerce API
@Developer Implement user authentication
@DevOps-Engineer Set up automated deployment
```

**That's it.** Your team is active and ready to build.

## How It Works

### Your Team Scales Automatically
- **Portfolio Site:** 6 specialists handle design, implementation, testing
- **Web App:** 8 specialists add database and backend testing
- **Enterprise SaaS:** All 12 specialists for complete coverage

### Professional Git Workflow
```bash
# Your team follows proper development practices
git checkout -b feature/user-auth
git commit -m "auth: Add JWT authentication system"
@PM mr create  # Creates PR/MR automatically
@PM mr merge   # Merges after review
```

### Growing Team Intelligence
- **Level 1:** Team asks for everything
- **Level 2:** Team handles implementation, asks for architecture
- **Level 3:** Team makes all technical decisions independently

### Awesome Features
‚ú® **Smart Versioning** - Automatic version bumps and changelog generation  
üîç **Change Detection** - Keyword analysis determines branching needs  
üîÄ **Unified Git Platform** - Same commands work for GitHub and GitLab  
üõ°Ô∏è **Workflow Enforcement** - Prevents messy commits to main branch  
üìä **Progress Tracking** - Single progress file per day, zero document sprawl

## Essential Commands

### Get Started
```bash
@PM init                     # Analyze project and configure team
@PM Build me a [project]     # Start any project with intelligent role selection
```

### Manage Versions
```bash
@PM version                  # Show current version
@PM version bump minor       # Smart version increment with changelog
```

### Git Operations
```bash
@PM mr create               # Create PR/MR (works with GitHub and GitLab)

## Why Choose Virtual Team Mode?

### üéØ **Focus on Building, Not Managing**
Your team handles technical decisions autonomously. You focus on features and business goals while specialists manage implementation details, security, testing, and deployment.

### üìà **Grows With Your Project**
Start with 6 specialists for a simple website. Scale to 12 for enterprise applications. The team composition adapts automatically based on project complexity.

### üîß **Professional Git Workflow**
No more messy commits or broken main branches. Your team follows proper branching, creates merge requests, and maintains clean commit history automatically.

### ‚ö° **Zero Learning Curve**
Simple @-notation gets you started immediately. `@Developer fix this bug` or `@Architect design this system` - it's that intuitive.

## Installation & Setup

### Quick Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ksamaschke/intelligent-claude-code
cd intelligent-claude-code
make install                  # Installs to ~/.claude/
```

### Non-Invasive by Design
- **Single import line** added to your project
- **Preserves existing setup** completely
- **Remove anytime** by deleting one line
- **No environment variables** or hidden configs

### Platform Support
- **macOS/Linux:** Native support
- **Windows:** WSL or Docker
- **Remote servers:** SSH-based installation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: Context Compacting Recovery

**Claude Code has known context persistence issues.** When Claude Code compacts context or restarts sessions, your virtual team may become unresponsive or fail to switch roles properly.

### üö® **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION**
```bash
@PM restart
```

**If `@PM restart` doesn't work:**
```bash
@PM **CHANGE** THE ROLES!
```

**If PM still won't delegate properly:**
```bash
# Emergency role activation sequence
@PM coordinate, @Architect design, @Developer implement. Technical focus, Git workflow, autonomous decisions.
```

**Ultimate fallback:**
```bash
# Exit Claude Code session and restart, then Resume
# This forces complete context reload
```

### üìã **When You Need This**
- Team stops responding to @-notation commands
- **Roles not switching properly** (PM keeps implementing instead of delegating)
- After Claude Code session timeouts or interruptions
- After aggressive context compacting
- Virtual team seems "stuck" or unresponsive

### ‚ö° **Quick Recovery Checklist**
1. `@PM restart` - Primary recovery method
2. `@PM **CHANGE** THE ROLES!` - Force role switching if restart fails
3. Emergency role activation sequence if still stuck
4. **Ultimate**: Exit Claude Code ‚Üí Restart ‚Üí Resume session

**üí° Save this command**: Always start troubleshooting with `@PM restart`

## Troubleshooting

### Team Not Responding?
```bash
# Quick recovery (30 seconds)
@PM restart                     # Primary solution for context compacting
@PM Status check                # Test if team is active after restart
```

### GitHub/GitLab Issues?
```bash
@PM git status                  # Check platform and authentication
gh auth login                   # Fix GitHub authentication
glab auth login                 # Fix GitLab authentication
```
