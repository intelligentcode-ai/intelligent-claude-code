# Transform Claude Code into Your Development Team

**One import. 14 specialists. Behavioral intelligence. Professional workflows.**

Turn Claude Code into an intelligent virtual development team that uses behavioral patterns to coordinate work across specialized roles - from simple websites to enterprise applications.

## Quick Start

### Install (30 seconds)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ksamaschke/intelligent-claude-code
cd intelligent-claude-code
make install    # Installs to ~/.claude/
```

### Start Building
```bash
@PM Build me a portfolio website
@Architect Design a REST API  
@Developer Implement user auth
```

That's it. Your virtual team is active and building.

## Key Features

### üé≠ **Virtual Development Team**
14 specialized roles from PM to Security Engineer, each following structured command chains for consistent execution. They coordinate through parallel task delegation and maintain professional Git workflows.

### üß† **Behavioral Intelligence Architecture**
Every role follows streamlined behavioral patterns that ensure memory consultation, strategic thinking, and quality validation. Behavioral intelligence operates automatically while users interact naturally with @-roles.

### üöÄ **Dynamic Role Specialization**  
System can generate domain specialists (React, Kubernetes, etc.) with context-aware expertise loading. Specialists follow the same behavioral intelligence patterns as core roles.

### üìä **Dual Scoring System**
Real-time performance tracking with professionalism and quality scores. Team members improve through learning insights and evidence-based scoring. Features role replacement protocol at -10pts professionalism threshold.

### ü§ñ **Parallel Task Execution**
PM creates multiple simultaneous tasks that different roles can work on in parallel. No sequential bottlenecks - multiple specialists can contribute simultaneously.

### üìã **Memory-First Culture**
All roles must consult memory before taking actions and store results after completion. Creates persistent team knowledge and prevents repeated mistakes.

### üîÑ **Continuous Learning**
Automatic insight capture after significant actions. Learning callouts generated for major score changes. Team knowledge builds over time through memory integration.

## How It Works

Your team coordinates through behavioral intelligence that executes automatically:

**Behavioral Intelligence Flow:**
1. User addresses @PM or any role
2. Role executes behavioral patterns internally
3. Memory consultation ‚Üí Strategic thinking ‚Üí Execution ‚Üí Quality validation
4. Results stored and shared with team

Example workflow:
```bash
User: "Build a real-time chat application"

@PM: [Executes behavioral intelligence]
  ‚Üí Memory consultation for project context
  ‚Üí Strategic thinking analysis of requirements
  ‚Üí Parallel task delegation
    ‚Üí Task 1: @Architect "WebSocket architecture"
    ‚Üí Task 2: @Developer "Real-time UI components"
    ‚Üí Task 3: @DevOps-Engineer "Scaling infrastructure"
  ‚Üí [All roles execute simultaneously]
```

Every role follows behavioral intelligence patterns for consistency and quality.

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Project Management
@PM init                    # Configure existing project
@PM Build me a [project]    # Start any project with behavioral intelligence

# Role Communication
@Architect Design the API   # Architect behavioral patterns execute
@Developer Implement auth   # Developer behavioral patterns execute
@Security-Engineer Review   # Security behavioral patterns execute

# Team Performance
@PM Show team scores       # View scoring dashboard
@PM Team achievements      # See milestones & learning

# Natural Language
"I need a React component for user profiles"
# ‚Üí PM delegates to @React-Developer with behavioral intelligence
```

## System Architecture

This system uses a **streamlined behavioral intelligence framework** that guides role execution through two core behavioral patterns. It is not an automated enforcement system but rather a structured approach to AI collaboration that:

- Provides consistent behavioral patterns for role execution
- Encourages memory consultation and strategic thinking
- Facilitates parallel task coordination
- Maintains quality through intelligent behavioral patterns
- Builds team knowledge over time
- Operates through streamlined behavioral architecture

The system works best when used as intended - as a framework for organizing AI assistance through behavioral intelligence rather than rigid enforcement.
