## Quick Start

### Install (30 seconds)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ksamaschke/intelligent-claude-code
cd intelligent-claude-code
make install    # Installs to ~/.claude/
```

### Start Building
```bash
@PM Build me a portfolio website
@Architect Design a REST API  
@Developer Implement user auth
```

That's it. Your virtual team is active and building.

## Key Features

### üé≠ **Virtual Development Team**
14 specialized roles from PM to Security Engineer, each an ultra-experienced professional. They coordinate autonomously, review each other's work, and maintain professional Git workflows.

### üöÄ **Unlimited Dynamic Specialists**  
Need a React expert? Kubernetes engineer? Blockchain developer? The system generates domain specialists on-demand with real-time expertise injection for ANY technology.

### üìä **Dual Scoring System**
Real-time performance tracking with professionalism and quality scores. Team members improve through learning insights and are accountable for their work.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Mandatory Quality Enforcement**
Universal process compliance with auto-correction workflows. No shortcuts, no partial implementations, no "good enough" solutions. 100% completion standards.

### ü§ñ **Level 3 Autonomous Operations**
Your team makes technical decisions independently. You're only involved for business decisions like budget, timeline, or policy changes.

## How It Works

Your team scales automatically based on project needs:

**Simple Website** ‚Üí 6 specialists handle everything  
**Web Application** ‚Üí 8 specialists + framework experts  
**Enterprise System** ‚Üí All 14 roles + unlimited domain experts

Example workflow:
```bash
User: "Build a real-time chat application"

@PM: Analyzing requirements and coordinating team...
@Architect: Designing WebSocket architecture with scaling...  
@React-Developer: *Generated* - Implementing real-time UI...
@DevOps-Engineer: Setting up auto-scaling infrastructure...
```

Every step follows mandatory quality gates with peer review, testing, and security validation.

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Project Management
@PM init                    # Configure existing project
@PM Build me a [project]    # Start any project

# Git Workflow  
@PM mr create              # Create pull request
@PM mr merge               # Merge after review
