## Quick Start

### Install (30 seconds)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ksamaschke/intelligent-claude-code
cd intelligent-claude-code
make install    # Installs to ~/.claude/
```

**What happens during `make install`:**
1. **Checks for Ansible** - Verifies ansible-playbook is available (searches common locations)
2. **Creates directory structure** - Sets up `~/.claude/` and `~/.claude/modes/` directories
3. **Installs core files** - Copies virtual team mode files to `~/.claude/modes/`
4. **Creates CLAUDE.md** - Adds main configuration file with virtual team import
5. **Preserves existing configs** - Never overwrites existing `config.md`, `scores.md`, or user modifications
6. **Graceful integration** - Adds single import line to existing CLAUDE.md files without overwriting

### Start Building
```bash
@PM Build me a portfolio website
@Architect Design a REST API  
@Developer Implement user auth
```

That's it. Your virtual team is active and building.

## Key Features

### üé≠ **Virtual Development Team**
14 specialized roles from PM to Security Engineer, each an ultra-experienced professional. They coordinate autonomously, review each other's work, and maintain professional Git workflows.

### üöÄ **Unlimited Dynamic Specialists**  
Need a React expert? Kubernetes engineer? Blockchain developer? The system generates domain specialists on-demand with real-time expertise injection for ANY technology.

### üìä **Dual Scoring System**
Real-time performance tracking with professionalism and quality scores. Team members improve through learning insights and are accountable for their work. Features role replacement protocol at -10pts professionalism threshold with mandatory knowledge transfer.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Mandatory Quality Enforcement**
Universal process compliance with auto-correction workflows. No shortcuts, no partial implementations, no "good enough" solutions. 100% completion standards with mandatory memory consultation before all actions and 10 process gates.

### ü§ñ **Level 3 Autonomous Operations**
Your team makes technical decisions independently. You're only involved for business decisions like budget, timeline, or policy changes.

### üìã **Interactive Planning Support**
Collaborate with PM and Architect to create epics, stories, and tasks. Your team autonomously picks up prioritized work from the backlog.

## How It Works

Your team scales automatically based on project needs:

**Simple Website** ‚Üí 6 specialists handle everything  
**Web Application** ‚Üí 8 specialists + framework experts  
**Enterprise System** ‚Üí All 14 roles + unlimited domain experts

Example workflow:
```bash
User: "Build a real-time chat application"

@PM: Analyzing requirements and coordinating team...
@Architect: Designing WebSocket architecture with scaling...  
@React-Developer: *Generated* - Implementing real-time UI...
@DevOps-Engineer: Setting up auto-scaling infrastructure...
```

Every step follows mandatory quality gates with peer review, testing, and security validation.

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Project Management
@PM init                    # Configure existing project
@PM Build me a [project]    # Start any project

# Planning & Backlog
@PM plan                   # Start interactive planning session
@PM plan next              # Show next priority item

# Git Workflow  
@PM mr create              # Create pull request
@PM mr merge               # Merge after review

# Team Performance
@PM Show team scores       # View scoring dashboard
@PM Team achievements      # See milestones & learning
```
