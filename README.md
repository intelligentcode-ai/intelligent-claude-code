## Quick Start

### Install (30 seconds)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ksamaschke/intelligent-claude-code
cd intelligent-claude-code
make install    # Installs to ~/.claude/
```

### Start Building
```bash
@PM Build me a portfolio website
@Architect Design a REST API  
@Developer Implement user auth
```

That's it. Your virtual team is active and building.

## Key Features

### 🎭 **Virtual Development Team**
14 specialized roles from PM to Security Engineer, each an ultra-experienced professional. They coordinate autonomously, review each other's work, and maintain professional Git workflows.

### 🚀 **Unlimited Dynamic Specialists**  
Need a React expert? Kubernetes engineer? Blockchain developer? The system generates domain specialists on-demand with real-time expertise injection for ANY technology.

### 📊 **Dual Scoring System**
Real-time performance tracking with professionalism and quality scores. Team members improve through learning insights and are accountable for their work. Features role replacement protocol at -10pts professionalism threshold with mandatory knowledge transfer.

### 🛡️ **Autonomous Process Excellence**
Team collaboration for process compliance with visibility and peer support. No blocking mechanisms - continuous autonomous operation with team intervention for quality. 100% completion standards through collaborative excellence.

### 🤖 **Level 3 Autonomous Operations**
Your team makes technical decisions independently. You're only involved for business decisions like budget, timeline, or policy changes.

### 📋 **Auto-Triggered Planning Mode**
Enhancement requests automatically activate comprehensive planning: Requirements → Architecture → Epic/Story → Implementation → Test → Validate → Document → Deploy. Complete end-to-end delivery without manual intervention.

### 🔄 **Event-Driven Role Optimization**
Milestone-based assessment of project role requirements with gap detection and specialist recommendations. <70% capability coverage triggers automatic specialist creation with Context7 knowledge injection.

## How It Works

Your team scales automatically based on project needs:

**Simple Website** → 6 specialists handle everything  
**Web Application** → 8 specialists + framework experts  
**Enterprise System** → All 14 roles + unlimited domain experts

Example workflow:
```bash
User: "Build a real-time chat application"

@PM: Analyzing requirements and coordinating team...
@Architect: Designing WebSocket architecture with scaling...  
@React-Developer: *Generated* - Implementing real-time UI...
@DevOps-Engineer: Setting up auto-scaling infrastructure...
```

Every step follows mandatory quality gates with peer review, testing, and security validation.
