# Transform Claude Code into Your Development Team

**One import. 14 specialists. Behavioral intelligence. Professional workflows.**

Turn Claude Code into an intelligent virtual development team that uses behavioral patterns to coordinate work across specialized roles - from simple websites to enterprise applications.

## Quick Start

### Install (30 seconds)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ksamaschke/intelligent-claude-code
cd intelligent-claude-code
make install    # Installs to ~/.claude/
```

### Start Building
```bash
@PM Build me a portfolio website
@Architect Design a REST API  
@Developer Implement user auth
```

That's it. Your virtual team is active and building.

## Key Features

### üé≠ **Virtual Development Team**
14 specialized roles from PM to Security Engineer, each following structured command chains for consistent execution. They coordinate through parallel task delegation and maintain professional Git workflows.

### üß† **Streamlined Behavioral Intelligence**
Every role follows two core behavioral patterns that ensure memory consultation, strategic thinking, and quality validation. The streamlined architecture provides professional outcomes through automatic behavioral intelligence while maintaining natural @-role interaction.

### üöÄ **Dynamic Role Specialization**  
System can generate domain specialists (React, Kubernetes, etc.) with context-aware expertise loading. Specialists follow the same behavioral intelligence patterns as core roles.

### üìä **Dual Scoring System**
Real-time performance tracking with professionalism and quality scores. Team members improve through learning insights and evidence-based scoring. Features role replacement protocol at -10pts professionalism threshold.

### ü§ñ **Parallel Task Execution**
PM creates multiple simultaneous tasks that different roles can work on in parallel. No sequential bottlenecks - multiple specialists can contribute simultaneously.

### üìã **Memory-First Culture**
All roles must consult memory before taking actions and store results after completion. Creates persistent team knowledge and prevents repeated mistakes.

### üîÑ **Continuous Learning**
Automatic insight capture after significant actions. Learning callouts generated for major score changes. Team knowledge builds over time through memory integration.

## How It Works

Your team coordinates through behavioral intelligence that executes automatically:

**Streamlined Behavioral Intelligence Flow:**
1. User addresses @PM or any role
2. Runtime Execution behavior activates automatically
3. Command Chain pattern executes: Memory consultation ‚Üí Strategic thinking ‚Üí Execution ‚Üí Quality validation
4. Results stored and shared with team through natural responses

Example workflow:
```bash
User: "Build a real-time chat application"

@PM: [Runtime Execution & Command Chain behaviors activate]
  ‚Üí Memory consultation for project context
  ‚Üí Strategic thinking analysis of requirements
  ‚Üí Parallel task delegation through command chains
    ‚Üí Task 1: @Architect "WebSocket architecture"
    ‚Üí Task 2: @Developer "Real-time UI components"
    ‚Üí Task 3: @DevOps-Engineer "Scaling infrastructure"
  ‚Üí [All roles execute with behavioral intelligence]
```

Every role follows the streamlined two-behavior architecture for consistency and quality.

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Project Management
@PM init                    # Configure existing project
@PM Build me a [project]    # Start any project with behavioral intelligence

# Role Communication
@Architect Design the API   # Architect behavioral patterns execute
@Developer Implement auth   # Developer behavioral patterns execute
@Security-Engineer Review   # Security behavioral patterns execute

# Team Performance
@PM Show team scores       # View scoring dashboard
@PM Team achievements      # See milestones & learning

# Natural Language
"I need a React component for user profiles"
# ‚Üí PM delegates to @React-Developer with behavioral intelligence
```

## Streamlined System Architecture

This system uses a **consolidated behavioral intelligence framework** built on two essential behaviors that guide all role execution. The streamlined architecture provides:

### Consolidation Benefits
- **Simplified Architecture**: Reduced from 17 separate behavioral files to 2 core behaviors
- **Enhanced Performance**: Streamlined execution with automatic quality assurance
- **Better User Experience**: Natural @-role interaction with invisible behavioral intelligence
- **Easier Maintenance**: Clear responsibilities and reduced complexity

### Core Behaviors
1. **Runtime Execution**: Automatic role activation, expertise loading, and coordination
2. **Command Chains**: Structured process patterns for memory, thinking, and quality

### Design Philosophy
- Behavioral intelligence operates automatically and transparently
- Users interact naturally with @-roles while quality patterns ensure excellence
- Professional development practices are built into every interaction
- Team coordination happens through parallel execution and shared memory

The system works as an intelligent framework for AI collaboration, providing structure and quality without enforcement complexity.
