/init     # First setup: Validates configuration, activates team
/reset    # Stuck system: Clears issues, fresh restart
/refresh  # Updates: Syncs tools, enhances capabilities
```

## Key Features

### üé≠ **Virtual Development Team**
14 specialized roles from PM to Security Engineer, each following structured command chains for consistent execution. They coordinate through parallel task delegation and maintain professional Git workflows.

### üß† **Pseudo-Code Behavioral Intelligence**
Hybrid documentation approach combining human-readable markdown with structured pseudo-code implementation patterns. System provides actionable implementation logic that translates directly to any programming language, including Level 3 autonomous operation with HALT/BLOCK enforcement patterns, automatic violation detection, and comprehensive auto-correction workflows.

### üìã **Mandatory Acceptance Criteria**
All tasks require specific, measurable acceptance criteria using the ‚úÖ format. Tasks are automatically blocked until criteria are defined, ensuring clear success metrics and validation methods before execution begins.

### üéì **Learning Team Principles**
Forgiving learning culture where first errors become learning opportunities with no penalties. Repeated identical errors trigger penalties, while active learning application earns bonus points. Creates a growth-oriented environment with intelligent error tracking.

### üîç **Role Contradiction Detection**
Automatic detection of role capability mismatches with intelligent reassignment protocols. AI-agentic tasks require specialized AI roles, preventing capability gaps and ensuring optimal task routing.

### üöÄ **Unlimited Dynamic Specialists**  
Context-aware generation of domain experts for ANY technology (React, Kubernetes, machine learning, etc.). Automatic capability matching with <70% threshold triggering specialist creation. Context7 integration provides real-time domain knowledge injection.

### üìä **Dual Scoring System**
Real-time performance tracking with professionalism and quality scores. Team members improve through learning insights and evidence-based scoring. Features role replacement protocol at -10pts professionalism threshold.

## Autonomy Levels

### Level 3: Complete Technical Autonomy
- **Autonomous Technical Decisions**: Architecture, implementation, infrastructure, security, performance, quality, tool selection
- **Continuous Operation**: Self-correcting quality loops without user intervention
- **Strategic Business Escalation**: Only escalates budget, timeline, stakeholder, and policy decisions
- **Self-Monitoring**: Automatic corrective action for quality issues
- **Non-Blocking Quality Gates**: Autonomous validation with self-correction until complete

### ü§ñ **Level 3 Autonomous Operation**
Complete technical autonomy with continuous operation. PM makes all technical decisions independently (architecture, implementation, security). Only escalates strategic business decisions (budget, timeline, stakeholder). Self-correcting quality loops prevent workflow stalls.

### üìã **Memory-First Culture**
All roles must consult memory before taking actions and store results after completion. Simplified memory format enables easy recall and relationship tracking for persistent team knowledge.

### üîÑ **Continuous Learning**
Automatic insight capture after significant actions. Learning callouts generated for major score changes. Team knowledge builds over time through memory integration and user observation feedback.

## How It Works

Your team operates through enforced behavioral patterns with mandatory compliance:

**Level 3 Autonomous Execution Flow:**
1. User addresses @PM or any role
2. Mandatory enforcement BLOCKS until protocols met
3. FORCED command chain: Memory-first (HALT -1.0P penalty) ‚Üí Sequential thinking (FORCE if complex) ‚Üí Parallel task execution ‚Üí Self-correcting quality loops
4. Autonomous technical decisions with strategic business escalation only
5. Continuous operation with automatic violation correction

Example autonomous workflow:
```bash
# System initialization
/init  # Validates configuration, activates Level 3 autonomy

User: "Build a real-time chat application"

@PM: [Autonomous Technical Decision Making]
  ‚Üí FORCED memory consultation (-1.0P penalty if skipped)
  ‚Üí Autonomous requirements analysis + architecture decisions
  ‚Üí Parallel specialist creation and task delegation:
    ‚Üí Auto-creates @WebSocket-Engineer for real-time protocols
    ‚Üí @Frontend-Developer: React chat UI components  
    ‚Üí @Backend-Developer: Node.js/Socket.io server
    ‚Üí @DevOps-Engineer: Auto-scaling infrastructure
  ‚Üí Continuous autonomous execution with self-correcting quality
  ‚Üí Only escalates: budget approval, timeline confirmation, stakeholder decisions

# System management (when needed)
/reset   # Clears penalties, fresh autonomous restart
/refresh # Updates capabilities, tool integrations
```

Every role follows the streamlined two-behavior architecture for consistency and quality.

## User Observation Integration

The system continuously learns from user interactions to improve team effectiveness:

### Learning Team Principles
- **First Error Forgiveness**: Initial mistakes become learning opportunities with no score penalties
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identical errors are tracked in memory with full penalties for repetition
- **Active Learning Rewards**: Applying previous lessons earns +0.5P/Q bonus points
- **Growth Culture**: Focus on improvement and knowledge building over punishment

### Mandatory Acceptance Criteria
All tasks require specific, measurable success criteria:
```
‚úÖ [Specific measurable outcome with clear success criteria]
‚úÖ [Validation method to verify completion]  
‚úÖ [Evidence requirement that proves success]
```
Tasks are automatically blocked until criteria are properly defined.

### Role Contradiction Detection
- **Capability Matching**: Automatic detection when roles lack required expertise
- **AI-Specialist Requirements**: AI-agentic tasks must be handled by AI specialist roles
- **Intelligent Reassignment**: Automatic role creation for <70% capability matches
- **Context Knowledge Injection**: Specialists receive domain expertise through Context7 integration

### Simplified Memory Format
Streamlined knowledge capture for easy recall:
- **Entity Types**: TechnicalPattern, BusinessRule, UserPreference, LearningInsight
- **Quick Relationships**: Simple connections between concepts and decisions
- **Search Optimization**: Efficient retrieval of past solutions and patterns
- **Team Knowledge**: Shared understanding accessible to all roles

## Essential Commands
