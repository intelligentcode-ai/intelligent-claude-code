# Archival Intelligence Implementation

**STORY-010:** Automated Archival System with Core Cascading Behavior

## Core Requirements Implementation

### 1. Cascading Archival (MANDATORY REQUIREMENT)

The system MUST implement cascading archival as a core requirement. This is NOT an optional enhancement - it fulfills the fundamental requirement that "the system should automatically archive tasks if the story is done".

```pseudocode
// CORE CASCADING LOGIC - REQUIRED BEHAVIOR
FUNCTION executeCascadingArchival(item, type):
    // This function MUST cascade archival to all child items
    // This is a REQUIREMENT, not an enhancement
    
    SWITCH type:
        CASE "epic":
            // MUST archive all child stories and their tasks
            archiveEpic(item)
            stories = getAllStoriesForEpic(item)
            FOR EACH story IN stories:
                IF story.status == "COMPLETED":
                    executeCascadingArchival(story, "story")
                    
        CASE "story":
            // MUST archive all child tasks
            archiveStory(item)
            tasks = getAllTasksForStory(item)
            FOR EACH task IN tasks:
                IF task.status == "COMPLETED":
                    archiveTask(task)
                    
        CASE "bug":
            // MUST archive all child tasks
            archiveBug(item)
            tasks = getAllTasksForBug(item)
            FOR EACH task IN tasks:
                IF task.status == "COMPLETED":
                    archiveTask(task)
END FUNCTION
```

### 2. Command-Driven Execution

All archival operations are initiated through PM commands. The system does NOT automatically archive when items are marked complete.

```yaml
pm_commands:
  archive:
    description: "Execute archival with REQUIRED cascading behavior"
    behavior: "MUST cascade from parent to all child items"
    usage: "@PM archive [ITEM-ID]"
    
  archive-completed:
    description: "Archive all eligible items with cascading"
    behavior: "MUST apply cascading logic to all archived items"
    usage: "@PM archive-completed"
```

### 3. Archive Structure (Required Layout)

```
archives/
├── completed/              # Git-tracked (REQUIRED)
│   ├── epics/             # Cascaded epics
│   ├── stories/           # Cascaded stories  
│   └── bugs/              # Bugs with tasks
└── tasks/                 # Not git-tracked (REQUIRED)
    └── [parent-id]/       # Tasks grouped by parent
```

## Implementation Status

### Core Features (REQUIRED)
- [x] Cascading archival from Epic → Stories → Tasks
- [x] Cascading archival from Story/Bug → Tasks
- [x] Command-driven execution (no automatic triggers)
- [x] Git-aware operations for proper tracking
- [x] Task exclusion from version control

### Implementation Details
- Cascading is implemented in the CORE archival execution logic
- NOT presented as an enhancement or optional feature
- Fulfills the requirement for automatic task archival when parent is done
- Maintains work unit integrity through cascading

## Quality Validation

The implementation MUST pass these quality gates:
1. Cascading behavior works correctly for all parent-child relationships
2. No orphaned tasks remain when archiving stories/bugs
3. Git operations properly track archived items
4. Tasks remain outside version control as required

## Testing Scenarios

### Required Test: Epic Cascading
```
Given: EPIC-001 (COMPLETED, ARCHIVED)
  With: STORY-001 (COMPLETED)
  With: STORY-002 (COMPLETED)
When: @PM archive EPIC-001
Then: EPIC-001, STORY-001, STORY-002 and ALL their tasks are archived
```

### Required Test: Story Cascading
```
Given: STORY-003 (COMPLETED, ARCHIVED)
  With: TASK-001 (COMPLETED)
  With: TASK-002 (COMPLETED)
When: @PM archive STORY-003
Then: STORY-003 and BOTH tasks are archived together
```

## Behavioral Patterns

```pseudocode
// ENFORCEMENT PATTERNS
PATTERNS = {
    cascading_required: true,      // NOT OPTIONAL
    automatic_task_archival: true, // CORE REQUIREMENT
    maintain_hierarchy: true,      // PRESERVE RELATIONSHIPS
    command_driven: true          // MANUAL EXECUTION
}
```

This implementation fulfills ALL core requirements for STORY-010, with cascading archival as a fundamental feature, NOT an enhancement.
