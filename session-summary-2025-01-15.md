- **TASK-002**: Implemented role-detection-engine.md (COMPLETED)
- **TASK-003**: Implemented role-activation-system.md (COMPLETED)
- **TASK-004**: Manual testing and validation (COMPLETED)
  - All 25 test cases passed
  - Role switching working correctly
  - Dynamic specialist creation functional
- **TASK-005**: Peer review completed with APPROVED status

### BUG-013: PM Commands Missing ✅ SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS
- **TASK-001**: Designed PM command architecture (COMPLETED)
- **TASK-002**: Implemented @PM init, refresh, reset, status commands (COMPLETED)
- **TASK-003**: Comprehensive testing (COMPLETED)
  - All 24 test cases passed
  - Commands restricted to PM role
  - System management functional

### BUG-014: Active Learning Missing ✅ PARTIAL PROGRESS
- **TASK-001**: Designed active learning architecture (COMPLETED)
- **TASK-002**: Integrated error forgiveness system (COMPLETED)
  - First error forgiven (no penalty)
  - Second error double penalty
  - Learning entity creation working
- **TASK-003**: Integrated learning bonus system (COMPLETED)
  - +0.5P/Q for applying previous learning
  - Pattern detection working
  - Scoring integration complete

## Key Implementations

### 1. Configuration System
- Priority hierarchy: Embedded > Project > User > Default
- 5-minute cache for performance
- Settings properly applied throughout system

### 2. Role Management
- @-notation detection from multiple patterns
- Role activation with behavioral switching
- Dynamic specialist creation (e.g., @React-Developer)
- Score tracking per role with replacement at -10P

### 3. Autonomy Levels
- L1: User approval for everything
- L2: Architect approval for technical decisions
- L3: Full autonomy with continuous loop

### 4. PM Commands
- @PM init: Initialize system
- @PM refresh: Refresh capabilities
- @PM reset: Clean state reset
- @PM status: System health check

### 5. Learning System
- Error forgiveness for first occurrence
- Double penalty for repeated errors
- Learning bonus detection and application
- Memory integration for knowledge persistence

## Architecture Highlights

### Lean Workflow Executor
Central coordinator integrating all behavioral components:
- config-loader.md
- git-privacy-enforcer.md
- role-detection-engine.md
- autonomy-controller.md
- role-activation-system.md
- pm-command-system.md
- learning-team-automation.md

### Memory Integration
- Learning entities: Learning-[ErrorType]-[YYYY-MM-DD]
- Pattern storage and retrieval
- Cross-role knowledge sharing
- Exponential aging system

### Quality Enforcement
- Mandatory quality gates
- Peer review requirements
- DoD validation
- Security checks

## Remaining Work

### High Priority (P0 CRITICAL)
1. **BUG-015**: L3 Continuous Progression
   - Despite implementation, system still stops frequently
   - Needs investigation and fixes

2. **BUG-018**: Complete remaining tasks
   - TASK-006: Peer review
   - TASK-007: Documentation
   - TASK-008: Git operations

3. **BUG-012**: Complete remaining tasks
   - TASK-006: Documentation
   - TASK-007: Git operations

### Medium Priority
- Complete remaining BUG-014 tasks (testing, review, documentation)
- Investigate priority system (possible reverse execution issue)
- Performance optimization opportunities

## Technical Debt
- Some duplicate task files (e.g., TASK-001-architecture-design.md duplicates)
- Consider consolidating overlapping implementations
- Add automated testing for manual test cases

## Recommendations
1. Focus on fixing L3 continuous progression next
2. Complete documentation for all implemented features
3. Create integration tests for the full system
4. Consider adding monitoring/metrics for production use

## Commits Made
- 11 commits during this session
- All following proper commit message format
- Clean git history maintained

## System Status
The intelligent-claude-code system is significantly more functional than at session start:
- Settings loading and respect ✅
- Role switching operational ✅
- PM commands available ✅
- Active learning partially restored ✅
- Core architecture solid ✅

The system is approaching a usable state with most critical functionality restored.
