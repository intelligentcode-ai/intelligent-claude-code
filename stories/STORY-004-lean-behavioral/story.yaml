  Replace the complex behavioral enforcement system with a single lean workflow
  executor. The workflow IS the behavior - assignment files contain all needed
  instructions. This makes the system LEAN and reduces context bloat by 80%.
  
acceptance_criteria:
  - Single workflow-executor.md replaces behavioral modules
  - All behavior driven by assignment file structure
  - No penalties, monitoring, or complex prompts
  - Context size reduced by 80%
  - System remains fully functional

technical_notes: |
  - Preserve only: task reading, execution, status update
  - Remove: penalties, monitoring, enforcement patterns
  - Assignment files become single source of truth
  - Simpler system is more reliable system
