I need a user authentication system for my web application.

Users should be able to:
- Register with email and password
- Log in with their credentials  
- Stay logged in for 30 days
- Reset their password via email
- Update their profile information
- Log out

Technical requirements:
- Use JWT tokens for authentication
- Store user data in PostgreSQL
- Implement proper password hashing
- Add rate limiting to prevent brute force
- Include email verification for new accounts

The frontend is React and the backend is Node.js with Express.
