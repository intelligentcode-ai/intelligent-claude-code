# STORY-002: Create Best-Practices from Operations

**Status:** Ready  
**Priority:** High  
**Created:** 2025-01-09  
**Requestor:** User  
**Epic:** Learning & Knowledge Management  

## Story
As a developer using intelligent-claude-code, I want the system to automatically identify and create best-practice documentation from successful operations, so that proven patterns are captured, reused, and continuously improved across all work.

## Background
The system currently has a best-practices directory structure but lacks the capability to dynamically generate best-practices from actual operations. Successful patterns in Git workflows, PR processes, implementation approaches, and other operations should be captured as reusable best-practices.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality

1. **Pattern Recognition**
   - System identifies successful patterns worthy of best-practice documentation
   - Patterns include but are not limited to:
     - Git PR processes and workflows
     - Implementation patterns that work well
     - Error recovery strategies
     - Testing approaches
     - Documentation patterns
     - Collaboration workflows
     - Architecture decisions

2. **Best-Practice Generation**
   - Automatic generation of best-practice documents from identified patterns
   - Structured format matching existing best-practices/ directory organization
   - Include context, problem, solution, and usage examples
   - Reference the original operation/PRB that demonstrated the pattern

3. **User Approval Workflow**
   - When system identifies potential best-practice:
     - Present proposed best-practice to user
     - Include rationale for why it's worthy of capture
     - User can approve, modify, or reject
   - When user requests best-practice creation:
     - Generate from specified operation or pattern
     - Allow user to refine before finalizing

4. **Integration with PRB System**
   - PRBs automatically search and embed relevant best-practices
   - Best-practices influence execution approach
   - System learns which best-practices are most effective

5. **Application Outside PRBs**
   - Git operations reference relevant best-practices
   - Manual operations guided by best-practices
   - System suggests best-practices for current context

### Technical Requirements

1. **Pattern Detection Engine**
   - Analyze successful operations for reusable patterns
   - Score patterns for best-practice worthiness
   - Track pattern usage and effectiveness

2. **Best-Practice Structure**
   ```markdown
   # Best Practice: [Title]
   
   ## Context
   When this pattern applies
   
   ## Problem
   What challenge this addresses
   
   ## Solution
   The proven approach
   
   ## Implementation
   Step-by-step guide
   
   ## Examples
   Real usage from operations
   
   ## Metrics
   Success rate, usage count, effectiveness score
   
   ## Source
   Original PRB/operation that demonstrated this
   ```

3. **Storage Organization**
   - Store in appropriate best-practices/ subdirectory
   - Maintain index for quick search
   - Version control all best-practices
   - Track modifications and improvements

4. **Search and Retrieval**
   - Intelligent matching based on current context
   - Relevance scoring for best-practice selection
   - Quick access during operations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System can identify patterns worthy of best-practice documentation
- [ ] User approval workflow implemented for system-identified patterns
- [ ] User can request best-practice creation from any operation
- [ ] Best-practices are automatically generated with complete structure
- [ ] PRBs search and embed relevant best-practices
- [ ] Git operations reference applicable best-practices
- [ ] Best-practices stored in organized directory structure
- [ ] Effectiveness metrics tracked for each best-practice
- [ ] System learns from best-practice usage patterns
- [ ] Documentation updated with best-practice creation process

## Success Metrics

1. **Capture Rate**: Number of valuable patterns captured as best-practices
2. **Reuse Rate**: How often best-practices are applied in new work
3. **Success Improvement**: Increase in operation success rate when best-practices applied
4. **Time Savings**: Reduction in time for similar operations
5. **Quality Improvement**: Fewer errors when following best-practices

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Git PR Process
After successfully creating, merging, and releasing (like BUG-003), system recognizes the pattern:
- Use PAT from ~/.config/git/common.conf
- Create PR with structured description
- Squash merge with branch deletion
- Create release with changelog
System proposes this as a best-practice for future PR workflows.

### Scenario 2: Bug Fix Pattern
System notices successful bug fix approach:
- Analyze bug for root cause
- Update behavioral patterns
- Create memory pattern
- Add validation rules
- Test thoroughly
Proposes as best-practice for similar architectural fixes.

### Scenario 3: User-Requested
User completes complex multi-PRB feature and requests:
"Create best-practice from the authentication implementation"
System generates best-practice from the PRB sequence.

## Dependencies
- Memory system for pattern storage
- PRB system for integration
- Behavioral patterns for enforcement
- File-based storage in best-practices/

## Out of Scope
- Automatic application without user awareness
- Modification of existing validated best-practices without approval
- Best-practices for external systems not in project scope

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Pattern recognition engine implemented
- [ ] Best-practice generation from operations working
- [ ] User approval workflow functional
- [ ] PRB integration complete
- [ ] Git operation integration working
- [ ] Storage and retrieval optimized
- [ ] Metrics tracking operational
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Memory patterns created for learnings
