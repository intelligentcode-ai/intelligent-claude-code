# STORY-006: Break Down Large Stories and PRBs

**Status:** Ready  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Created:** 2025-08-10  
**Requestor:** User  
**Epic:** Behavioral Enhancement  
**System Context:** MARKDOWN-BASED AI-AGENTIC SYSTEM

## Story
As an AI-agentic virtual team following behavioral instructions, I need behavioral patterns that mandate breaking down large stories and large PRBs into smaller, self-contained units, so that AI agents don't attempt to execute overly complex behavioral instructions in single passes.

## Background
The system currently attempts to execute large or very large stories/PRBs as single units, which leads to:
- Overwhelming complexity in single execution
- High failure rates for large items
- Difficulty tracking progress
- Lost context in massive PRBs
- Incomplete execution of complex work

## Requirements

### Core Functionality

1. **Size Detection and Breakdown**
   - Detect when story/PRB complexity exceeds threshold (>15 points = Large)
   - Automatically decompose into smaller units (<15 points each)
   - Maintain logical cohesion in breakdown
   - Preserve dependencies between parts

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Identify sequential dependencies
   - Create dependency graph
   - Execute in correct order
   - Block dependent work until prerequisites complete

3. **Automatic Decomposition Rules**
   ```yaml
   complexity_thresholds:
     mega: 30+     # MUST break down
     large: 16-30  # MUST break down  
     medium: 6-15  # Execute as-is
     tiny: 3-5     # Execute as-is
     nano: 0-2     # Execute as-is
   ```

4. **Breakdown Patterns**
   - **Functional Decomposition**: Split by feature/function
   - **Layer Decomposition**: Split by architectural layer
   - **Sequential Decomposition**: Split by execution order
   - **Domain Decomposition**: Split by specialist domain

### Process Requirements

1. **Story Breakdown**
   - Large story → Multiple smaller stories/bugs
   - Each sub-story self-contained
   - Clear parent-child relationships
   - Dependencies documented

2. **PRB Breakdown**
   - Large PRB → Multiple smaller PRBs
   - Each PRB executable independently
   - Sequential execution where needed
   - Aggregate completion tracking

3. **Execution Control**
   - REFUSE to execute Large/Mega items directly
   - REQUIRE breakdown first
   - Track sub-item completion
   - Aggregate status to parent

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System detects Large/Mega complexity items
- [ ] Automatic breakdown into <15 point units
- [ ] Dependencies correctly identified and ordered
- [ ] Execution blocked for non-decomposed large items
- [ ] Parent-child relationships maintained
- [ ] Progress tracking across sub-items
- [ ] No single PRB exceeds Medium complexity

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Large Story Breakdown
STORY-004 (External Memory Paths) - Complexity: ~25 points
Breaks down to:
1. STORY-004-A: Configuration System Updates (8 points)
2. STORY-004-B: Git Integration (7 points)  
3. STORY-004-C: Migration Tools (6 points)
4. STORY-004-D: Documentation (4 points)

### Scenario 2: Mega PRB Prevention
Attempting to create 40-point PRB:
- System BLOCKS creation
- Forces breakdown into 3-4 smaller PRBs
- Each PRB gets specific scope
- Dependencies chained properly

## Success Metrics

- Zero execution attempts on Large/Mega items
- All work items ≤15 points complexity
- 100% dependency ordering maintained
- Clear parent-child tracking
- Improved execution success rate

## Technical Implementation

1. **Complexity Calculation Enhancement**
   - More accurate point estimation
   - Multi-factor analysis
   - Breakdown triggers

2. **Dependency Graph**
   - DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) for dependencies
   - Topological sort for execution order
   - Blocking mechanisms

3. **Behavioral Enforcement**
   - PRB creation blocks for large items
   - Mandatory decomposition step
   - Execution guards

## Out of Scope

- External project management tools
- Gantt charts or visual planning
- Resource allocation
- Time-based scheduling

## Priority Justification

CRITICAL because the system is currently attempting to execute overly complex items as single units, leading to failures, incomplete work, and poor execution quality. This is a fundamental process improvement needed for reliable operation.
