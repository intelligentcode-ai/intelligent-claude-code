# Product Requirements Document: Subagents Integration

## Story ID: STORY-007

## Executive Summary
Integrate Claude Code's native Subagents feature into the intelligent-claude-code system to replace Task tool enforcement for execution roles while maintaining @PM coordination and architect collaboration patterns in the main agent context.

## Problem Statement
The current system relies heavily on Task tool enforcement for all role delegations, creating complexity and overhead. Claude Code's native Subagents feature offers a cleaner, more performant alternative for execution roles while preserving the coordination capabilities needed for @PM and architect collaboration.

## Goals
1. Replace Task tool enforcement with native subagent invocation for execution roles
2. Maintain @PM orchestration capabilities in main agent context
3. Preserve PM + Architect collaboration for PRB creation and role assignment
4. Simplify PRB execution patterns
5. Enable direct SME review assignment

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Subagent Creation**
   - Convert 12 execution roles to subagent definitions
   - Create subagent files in `.claude/agents/` directory
   - Support dynamic specialist subagent creation
   - Migrate role-specific behaviors into subagent system prompts

2. **Main Agent Coordination**
   - @PM remains in main agent context for orchestration
   - Specialist architects collaborate with PM in main context
   - PRB creation happens in main agent with full context access
   - Story breakdown remains PM responsibility in main agent

3. **Execution Pattern**
   - PRBs directly invoke subagents without Task tool wrapper
   - Subagents execute with role-specific system prompts
   - SME reviewers assigned as subagents for quality control
   - Remove Task tool enforcement from behaviors

4. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Maintain PRB template system unchanged
   - Preserve memory system functionality
   - Keep configuration hierarchy intact
   - Retain naming/numbering standards

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Direct subagent invocation should reduce execution latency
2. **Maintainability**: Simpler architecture with fewer enforcement layers
3. **Clarity**: Clear separation between coordination (main) and execution (subagents)
4. **Flexibility**: Easy creation of new dynamic specialist subagents

## Architecture

### Coordination Layer (Main Agent)
- @PM: Story creation, PRB orchestration, team coordination
- @[Specialist]-Architect: Collaborates with PM for PRB creation and role assignment
- PRB Generation: Full context access for template resolution
- Memory Operations: Search and storage in main context

### Execution Layer (Subagents)
- 12 Core Execution Roles as subagents
- Dynamic Specialists created on-demand
- SME Reviewers as specialized subagents
- Direct invocation from PRBs

## Success Criteria
1. All 12 execution roles successfully converted to subagents
2. PRB execution works without Task tool enforcement
3. PM + Architect collaboration pattern preserved
4. No regression in existing functionality
5. Simpler codebase with fewer enforcement behaviors

## Out of Scope
- Changing PRB template structure
- Modifying memory system
- Altering configuration hierarchy
- Changing naming/numbering standards
- Converting @PM to subagent

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Breaking existing PRB execution patterns
  - **Mitigation**: Phased rollout with backward compatibility
- **Risk**: Loss of enforcement capabilities
  - **Mitigation**: Embed enforcement in subagent system prompts
- **Risk**: Complex migration of behaviors
  - **Mitigation**: Incremental conversion with testing

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Create subagent definitions for 3 pilot roles
2. **Phase 2**: Update PRB execution to support both patterns
3. **Phase 3**: Convert remaining roles to subagents
4. **Phase 4**: Remove Task tool enforcement behaviors
5. **Phase 5**: Optimize and simplify remaining behaviors
