# STORY-003: Actively Generate and Utilize Memory

**Status:** Ready  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Created:** 2025-01-09  
**Requestor:** User  
**Epic:** Learning System Enhancement  

## Story
As a user of intelligent-claude-code, I want the system to proactively generate and utilize memory throughout all operations, so that it behaves as a true learning system that improves with every interaction rather than requiring repeated manual input.

## Background
The current memory system is too passive and formulaic, primarily generating memory only during PRB execution in predefined ways. This contradicts the fundamental principle of a learning AI-agentic system. The system should actively recognize patterns, store important information (while protecting sensitive data), and utilize this knowledge automatically in future operations.

## Problem Statement
Currently observed issues:
- System repeatedly asks for the same information (e.g., GitHub PAT location)
- Memory generation happens only at predefined points in PRBs
- Agents don't proactively store learnings from their operations
- System doesn't query memory before asking users for information
- Learning is mechanical rather than intelligent and situational

## Requirements

### Core Functionality

1. **Proactive Memory Generation**
   - Every agent invocation evaluates if learnings should be stored
   - Situation-aware memory creation based on:
     - Frequency of information use
     - Problem-solving patterns discovered
     - Configuration locations identified
     - Workflow optimizations found
     - Error recovery strategies learned
   - Not limited to PRB execution phases

2. **Intelligent Memory Queries**
   - ALWAYS check memory before asking user for information
   - Query memory for:
     - Configuration locations (e.g., ~/.config/git/common.conf)
     - Common procedures and workflows
     - Previously solved problems
     - Known file paths and structures
     - Established patterns and practices

3. **Security-Aware Storage**
   - NEVER store sensitive values directly (tokens, passwords, keys)
   - DO store locations of sensitive information
   - Store patterns for accessing sensitive data safely
   - Example: Store "GitHub PAT located in ~/.config/git/common.conf" not the PAT itself

4. **Context-Aware Learning**
   - Recognize when information becomes frequently needed
   - Identify patterns worth remembering
   - Understand relationships between different memory items
   - Build knowledge graphs of related concepts

5. **Multi-Agent Memory Sharing**
   - All agents can generate memory
   - Memory immediately available to all future operations
   - Agents build on each other's learnings
   - Collective intelligence grows with use

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Memory Generation Triggers**
   ```markdown
   SHOULD GENERATE MEMORY WHEN:
   - Information requested multiple times
   - New configuration location discovered
   - Successful problem resolution achieved
   - Workflow pattern established
   - Error recovery strategy works
   - Optimization opportunity identified
   - User provides clarification/correction
   ```

2. **Memory Query Protocol**
   ```markdown
   BEFORE ASKING USER:
   1. Search memory for answer
   2. Search memory for similar situations
   3. Search memory for related patterns
   4. Only ask if not found in memory
   ```

3. **Memory Entry Structure**
   ```markdown
   ## [Timestamp]: [Contextual Title]
   **Trigger:** What caused this memory creation
   **Learning:** What was learned
   **Application:** How to use this knowledge
   **Security:** Any sensitive data considerations
   **Frequency:** How often this is needed
   **Confidence:** Reliability score
   ```

4. **Sensitive Data Handling**
   - Detect sensitive patterns (tokens, keys, passwords)
   - Store references, not values
   - Include safe access patterns
   - Mark security-sensitive memories clearly

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Every agent evaluates memory generation opportunities
- [ ] Memory checked before requesting user information
- [ ] Sensitive data never stored directly in memory
- [ ] Memory generation happens throughout operations, not just in PRBs
- [ ] System demonstrates learning by not repeating questions
- [ ] Memory entries are contextual and actionable
- [ ] Agents share and build on collective memory
- [ ] Memory search is intelligent and context-aware
- [ ] Security protocols prevent data leakage
- [ ] User can review and manage memory entries

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: GitHub Authentication (Current Problem)
**Current:** System repeatedly asks about GitHub authentication
**Expected:** 
1. First use: System discovers PAT in ~/.config/git/common.conf
2. Generates memory: "GitHub PAT configuration location"
3. Future uses: Automatically sources from remembered location
4. Never stores actual token value

### Scenario 2: Project Structure Learning
**Current:** System rediscovers project structure each time
**Expected:**
1. System maps project structure once
2. Stores locations of key directories/files
3. Remembers custom configurations
4. Applies knowledge in future operations

### Scenario 3: Error Recovery Patterns
**Current:** Same errors handled manually each time
**Expected:**
1. System encounters and resolves error
2. Stores recovery pattern in memory
3. Automatically applies pattern when error recurs
4. Improves pattern based on outcomes

### Scenario 4: Workflow Optimization
**Current:** Workflows executed same way regardless of learnings
**Expected:**
1. System identifies faster/better approach
2. Stores optimization in memory
3. Suggests or applies optimization in future
4. Tracks effectiveness metrics

## Success Metrics

1. **Relevance-Based Generation**: System generates memory ONLY when relevance threshold is met (not quantity-based)
2. **Demonstrated Learning**: System shows it learned by applying knowledge without prompting
3. **Context-Appropriate Storage**: Memory entries match the importance and complexity of the learning
4. **Intelligent Retrieval**: System finds and applies the RIGHT memory for the situation
5. **Security Compliance**: Zero sensitive data leaks in memory
6. **Reduced User Friction**: Users no longer need to provide the same information repeatedly
7. **Quality Over Quantity**: Each memory entry has clear value and application

## Technical Considerations

1. **Memory Indexing**: Fast search across growing memory base
2. **Relevance Scoring**: Identify most applicable memories
3. **Memory Pruning**: Remove outdated or incorrect memories
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle contradictory memories
5. **Performance Impact**: Ensure memory operations don't slow system

## Out of Scope
- Storing actual sensitive values (tokens, passwords)
- Memory generation without relevance threshold
- Automatic memory deletion without user control
- Cross-project memory sharing (each project has own memory)

## Dependencies
- Enhanced memory search capabilities
- Security scanning for sensitive data
- Memory relevance scoring system
- Agent memory generation protocols

- [ ] Memory generation is situational, not formulaic
- [ ] System demonstrates active learning behavior
- [ ] Documentation updated with memory protocols
