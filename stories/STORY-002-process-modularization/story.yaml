description: |
  Separate process definitions into referenceable files allowing projects to
  customize their workflows while maintaining standard patterns. This enables
  ADJUSTABLE workflows that can adapt to different project needs.
  
acceptance_criteria:
  - Process templates stored in separate files
  - Assignment files reference process templates
  - Project-specific overrides supported
  - Standard processes provided out-of-box
  - IaC and other patterns modularized
