# Stories Directory

Write your stories here in any format - plain text, markdown, whatever works for you.

## Structure

- `stories/` - Stories ready to be broken down into PRBs
- `stories/drafts/` - Work-in-progress stories (not ready yet)

## Usage

1. Write a story describing what you want to achieve
2. Save it in `stories/` when ready (or `stories/drafts/` if still working on it)
3. Run `/icc-breakdown-story [filename]` to convert it to PRBs

That's it!
