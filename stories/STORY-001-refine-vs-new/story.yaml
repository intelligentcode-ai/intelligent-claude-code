  Implement clear distinction between REFINING (updating current task with
  more information) and creating NEW STORIES/BUGS (new observations/requirements).
  This prevents workflow disruption and maintains atomic task execution.
  
acceptance_criteria:
  - User comments on current task update assignment file only
  - System observations create new stories/bugs automatically
  - Workflow continues uninterrupted by meta-observations
  - Clear detection patterns for REFINE vs NEW
