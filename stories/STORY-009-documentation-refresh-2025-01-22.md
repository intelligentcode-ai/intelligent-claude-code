# Comprehensive Documentation Refresh After Agent Integration

## Story ID: STORY-009

## Executive Summary
Update all project documentation to reflect the completed agent system implementation from STORY-007 and template improvements from STORY-008. The current documentation does not accurately describe the system's capabilities, architecture, or usage patterns after these major enhancements.

## Problem Statement
The intelligent-claude-code documentation is significantly outdated following the implementation of:
1. STORY-007: Subagent integration with 14 core roles
2. STORY-008: PRB template simplification and validation improvements

Users and contributors cannot effectively understand or use the system based on current documentation. Critical features like the agent system, L3 autonomous mode, and enhanced PRB templates are undocumented or incorrectly described.

## Goals
1. Update all user-facing documentation to reflect current system state
2. Document the agent system architecture and usage
3. Refresh installation and setup instructions
4. Add comprehensive examples showing current capabilities
5. Create troubleshooting guides for common issues
6. Ensure consistency across all documentation

## Requirements

### Documentation Components to Update

#### Primary Documentation
1. **README.md**
   - Update feature list with agent system
   - Refresh quick start instructions
   - Document current capabilities accurately
   - Add agent usage examples
   - Update architecture overview

2. **CHANGELOG.md**
   - Add entries for v7.0.0 (STORY-007 completion)
   - Document STORY-008 template improvements
   - Include breaking changes and migration notes

3. **docs/user-guide.md**
   - Complete rewrite for current system
   - Agent interaction patterns
   - PRB generation workflows
   - Memory system usage
   - L3 autonomous mode operation

4. **docs/virtual-team-guide.md**
   - Document all 14 core roles
   - Explain dynamic specialist creation
   - Role capabilities and expertise areas
   - @PM coordination patterns
   - Architect collaboration process

#### Technical Documentation
5. **docs/commands-reference.md**
   - Ensure all /icc commands documented
   - Add new commands from STORY-007/008
   - Include examples for each command
   - Document command parameters and options

6. **docs/configuration-guide.md**
   - Document all configuration options
   - Explain configuration hierarchy
   - L3 autonomous mode settings
   - Agent-related configurations

7. **docs/prb-system-guide.md**
   - Update for simplified templates
   - Document validation improvements
   - Placeholder resolution process
   - Template selection criteria

8. **docs/prb-templates-guide.md**
   - Template complexity tiers
   - Customization instructions
   - Best practices for PRB creation

#### Operational Documentation
9. **docs/troubleshooting.md** (create new)
   - Common issues and solutions
   - Debugging techniques
   - Error message explanations
   - Recovery procedures

10. **docs/architecture.md** (create new)
    - System architecture overview
    - Agent system design
    - Memory system architecture
    - PRB execution flow

11. **docs/installation-guide.md** (enhance)
    - Detailed installation steps
    - Prerequisites and dependencies
    - Configuration after installation
    - Verification procedures

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All documentation reflects v7.0.0+ capabilities
- [ ] Agent system fully documented with examples
- [ ] No references to outdated Task tool enforcement
- [ ] L3 autonomous mode properly explained
- [ ] PRB templates accurately described
- [ ] Installation guide works for new users
- [ ] Examples run successfully
- [ ] Consistent terminology across all docs
- [ ] No contradictions between documents
- [ ] Troubleshooting covers common issues

### Constraints
- Maintain backward compatibility references where needed
- Preserve existing URL structure for documentation
- Keep documentation accessible to new users
- Technical accuracy while remaining readable

## Impact Analysis
- **Users**: Will have accurate documentation to use the system effectively
- **Contributors**: Can understand architecture for contributions
- **Maintainers**: Reduced support burden from outdated docs
- **Adoption**: Improved onboarding for new users

## Notes for @PM Breakdown
This story should be broken into 3-4 PRBs based on logical groupings:
- PRB-001: Core documentation (README, CHANGELOG, main guides)
- PRB-002: Technical documentation (commands, configuration, PRB guides)
- PRB-003: Operational documentation (troubleshooting, architecture, installation)
- PRB-004: Examples and validation (ensure all examples work)

Each PRB should be under 15 complexity points for manageable execution.

## Dependencies
- STORY-007-008-PRB-001 must be completed first (branch consolidation)
- All agent files must be present in src/agents/
- System must be in working state for validation
