# STORY-007: Domain Knowledge Integration

**Created:** 2025-08-11  
**Status:** Ready for Planning  
**Priority:** High  
**Category:** System Enhancement  

## Story

As a **user of the intelligent-claude-code system**, I want to **provide domain-specific knowledge in textual format** so that **the virtual team can leverage specialized expertise when implementing features, fixing bugs, and creating PRBs**.

## Background

The current system effectively integrates best practices through the `best-practices/` directory, allowing teams to capture and reuse proven methodological approaches. However, users need a way to provide domain-specific knowledge that goes beyond general practices - technical specifications, business rules, domain concepts, architectural constraints, and specialized implementation guidance.

This domain knowledge should be accessible during:
- PRB generation and context gathering
- Implementation work by specialist roles
- Architecture decisions and technical planning
- Bug analysis and resolution
- Memory pattern creation and learning

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Domain Knowledge Storage**
   - Users can create domain knowledge files in markdown/text format
   - Knowledge organized by domain/topic (similar to memory structure)
   - Support for hierarchical organization (domain → subdomain)
   - Files can include code examples, diagrams, specifications

2. **Knowledge Integration Points**
   - PRB generation searches relevant domain knowledge
   - Specialist roles access domain knowledge during implementation
   - Architects consult domain knowledge during design decisions
   - Memory system references domain knowledge patterns

3. **Knowledge Search and Discovery**
   - Keyword-based search across domain knowledge
   - Topic/domain-based organization and filtering
   - Integration with existing memory search capabilities
   - Relevance scoring for knowledge selection

4. **Dynamic Knowledge Loading**
   - Knowledge loaded based on work context (similar to best practices)
   - Configurable knowledge paths in project settings
   - Support for project-specific and user-global knowledge
   - Integration with configuration hierarchy

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Fast knowledge search during PRB generation
   - Efficient knowledge loading without blocking execution
   - Caching for frequently accessed knowledge

2. **Usability**
   - Simple file-based knowledge management
   - Clear organization patterns for knowledge discovery
   - Integration with existing workflow patterns

3. **Maintainability**
   - Version-controlled knowledge storage
   - Clear separation from code and configuration
   - Support for knowledge evolution and updates

│       └── best-practices.md
```

### Integration Points

1. **Configuration System**
   - Add `domain_knowledge_path` to directory structure configuration
   - Support hierarchy: project → user → system defaults
   - Path resolution similar to existing patterns

2. **PRB Generation Process**
   - Search domain knowledge during context gathering
   - Include relevant knowledge in PRB `complete_context`
   - Embed knowledge snippets alongside memory patterns
   - Limit knowledge inclusion (similar to memory token limits)

3. **Search Implementation**
   - Extend existing search patterns (similar to memory search)
   - Keyword extraction from work requests
   - File content search with relevance scoring
   - Support for metadata/frontmatter in knowledge files

4. **Template Integration**
   - Add domain knowledge placeholders to PRB templates
   - Knowledge search results embedded during placeholder resolution
   - Template validation includes knowledge integration checks

### Memory Integration

1. **Cross-Referencing**
   - Memory patterns can reference domain knowledge
   - Knowledge can inform memory pattern creation
   - Bidirectional relationships between memory and knowledge

2. **Learning Enhancement**
   - Domain knowledge informs learning pattern creation
   - Successful knowledge application tracked in memory
   - Knowledge gaps identified and stored for improvement

### Role-Specific Access

1. **Architect Integration**
   - Architecture knowledge accessed during design decisions
   - System design patterns and constraints available
   - Technology-specific architectural guidance

2. **Developer Integration**
   - Implementation-specific knowledge during coding
   - Code patterns and examples from domain knowledge
   - Technology stack specific guidance

## Notes

This story builds upon the successful best practices integration pattern while expanding to cover broader domain expertise. The implementation should leverage existing search, configuration, and integration patterns to ensure consistency with the current system architecture.

The domain knowledge system should complement, not replace, the existing memory and best practices systems, creating a comprehensive knowledge ecosystem for the virtual team.
