# STORY-005: Bug Lifecycle Management System

**Created:** 2025-08-09
**Priority:** High
**Category:** System Organization

## Story

As a virtual team system, I need automated bug lifecycle management that moves bugs through their lifecycle stages (open → in-progress → completed) similar to how PRBs are managed (ready → completed), so that the bug tracking remains organized and current.

## Background

Currently, bugs remain in the bugs/ directory even after being fixed. They're marked as "Open" despite having completed PRBs and merged fixes. This creates confusion about which bugs are actually active versus completed.

The system already has a good pattern with PRBs:
- `prbs/ready/` - PRBs ready for execution
- `prbs/completed/` - PRBs that have been executed

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Create `bugs/open/` and `bugs/completed/` directory structure
2. Bugs should move from open → completed when their PRB is completed
3. Bug status should automatically update when fix is merged
4. Behavioral pattern to enforce lifecycle management

### Technical Requirements  
1. Similar to PRB lifecycle management
2. Automated through behavioral patterns
3. Clear instructions for AI agents to follow
4. Integration with PRB completion process

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bugs have clear lifecycle stages: open → in-progress → completed
- [ ] Completed bugs automatically move to bugs/completed/
- [ ] Bug status updates when PRB completes
- [ ] Behavioral pattern documented for AI agents
- [ ] Works consistently with existing PRB lifecycle

## Success Metrics

- All fixed bugs properly archived in bugs/completed/
- No confusion about which bugs are active
- Clear audit trail of bug fixes
- Consistent with PRB management pattern

## Out of Scope

- External bug tracking systems
- Complex workflow states beyond open/in-progress/completed
- Integration with GitHub issues

## Notes

This story addresses the issue discovered when BUG-001, BUG-002, BUG-003, and BUG-005 were fixed but remained in the bugs/ directory marked as "Open". The system should handle bug lifecycle automatically, just like it handles PRB lifecycle.
