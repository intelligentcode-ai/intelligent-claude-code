# Research ML-Based Recommendation System

## Summary
Research and prototype machine learning approaches for implementing a personalized recommendation system to improve user engagement and content discovery.

## Context
Our platform has grown to 100K+ users and 1M+ content items. Users are having difficulty discovering relevant content, leading to decreased engagement. Analytics show that 60% of users only interact with content from their direct network. We need to research ML-based approaches to surface relevant content and improve discovery.

## Requirements
- Research suitable ML algorithms for recommendations
- Evaluate build vs. buy options
- Prototype 2-3 different approaches
- Analyze data requirements and availability
- Estimate infrastructure needs
- Consider privacy and ethical implications
- Provide recommendation with cost analysis

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Literature review of recommendation system approaches completed
- [ ] Analysis of our data availability and quality
- [ ] Prototype of collaborative filtering approach
- [ ] Prototype of content-based filtering approach
- [ ] Evaluation metrics defined (precision, recall, diversity)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks on sample dataset
- [ ] Infrastructure requirements documented
- [ ] Cost analysis for each approach (build and run)
- [ ] Privacy impact assessment completed
- [ ] Final recommendation report with pros/cons
- [ ] Presentation prepared for stakeholders

## Technical Details
### Approaches to Evaluate
1. **Collaborative Filtering**
   - User-based CF
   - Item-based CF
   - Matrix factorization (SVD, NMF)

2. **Content-Based Filtering**
   - TF-IDF similarity
   - Word embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT)
   - Feature extraction from content

3. **Hybrid Approaches**
   - Weighted hybrid
   - Switching hybrid
   - Mixed hybrid

4. **Deep Learning**
   - Neural collaborative filtering
   - Autoencoders
   - Transformer-based models

### Data Requirements Analysis
- User interaction data (views, likes, shares)
- Content metadata (tags, categories, text)
- User profiles (interests, demographics)
- Temporal patterns
- Social graph data

### Evaluation Metrics
- Precision@K
- Recall@K
- NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)
- Coverage
- Diversity
- Novelty
- Cold start performance

### Infrastructure Considerations
- Training pipeline (batch vs. real-time)
- Model serving latency requirements
- Storage for embeddings/features
- A/B testing framework
- Monitoring and retraining

## Notes
- Consider starting with simple baseline (popularity-based)
- Explore pre-trained models and transfer learning
- Research existing solutions: Amazon Personalize, Google Recommendations AI
- Consider explainability requirements for recommendations
- Plan for cold start problem (new users/items)
