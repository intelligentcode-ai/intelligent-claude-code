# Add User Profile API Endpoints

## Summary
Create REST API endpoints for user profile management including view, update, and delete operations.

## Context
Users need to be able to manage their profile information through the application. This is a core feature required before the public launch.

## Requirements
- [ ] GET /api/users/:id/profile - View profile
- [ ] PUT /api/users/:id/profile - Update profile
- [ ] DELETE /api/users/:id - Delete account
- [ ] Input validation for all endpoints
- [ ] Proper error handling and status codes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] Profile updates are validated (email format, required fields)
- [ ] Soft delete implemented for user accounts
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] Integration tests cover all endpoints
- [ ] Response times under 200ms

## Technical Notes
- Use existing authentication middleware
- Follow RESTful conventions
- Implement soft delete (set deleted_at timestamp)
- Return sanitized user data (no passwords)
