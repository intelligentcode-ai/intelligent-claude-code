# Refactor Payment Service for Better Testability

## Summary
Refactor the payment service to follow SOLID principles, improve testability by removing tight coupling with external payment providers, and implement proper dependency injection.

## Context
The current payment service has grown organically and now contains 2000+ lines of code in a single class. It's tightly coupled with Stripe and PayPal SDKs, making it difficult to test and add new payment providers. The code has become a maintenance burden with 40% test coverage and frequent bugs when making changes.

## Requirements
- Split monolithic PaymentService into smaller, focused services
- Implement strategy pattern for payment providers
- Use dependency injection for external dependencies
- Increase test coverage to >90%
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Zero downtime deployment

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PaymentService split into PaymentOrchestrator and provider-specific strategies
- [ ] Each payment provider implements common IPaymentProvider interface
- [ ] All external dependencies injected through constructor
- [ ] Unit test coverage increased to >90%
- [ ] Integration tests use mock payment providers
- [ ] No changes to external API contracts
- [ ] Performance remains within 5% of current baseline
- [ ] All existing payment flows work without modification
- [ ] New provider can be added by implementing interface only
- [ ] Code follows team's style guide and passes linting

## Technical Details
### Current Structure (Problem)
```javascript
class PaymentService {
  constructor() {
    this.stripe = new Stripe(STRIPE_KEY);
    this.paypal = new PayPal(PAYPAL_CONFIG);
    // ... 2000+ lines of mixed logic
  }
  
  processPayment(amount, provider, details) {
    // Giant switch statement with provider-specific logic
  }
}
```

### Target Structure
```javascript
// Payment Provider Interface
interface IPaymentProvider {
  charge(amount: Money, details: PaymentDetails): Promise<PaymentResult>;
  refund(transactionId: string, amount?: Money): Promise<RefundResult>;
  getTransactionStatus(transactionId: string): Promise<TransactionStatus>;
}

// Strategy Implementation Example
class StripePaymentProvider implements IPaymentProvider {
  constructor(private stripeClient: IStripeClient) {}
  
  async charge(amount: Money, details: PaymentDetails): Promise<PaymentResult> {
    // Stripe-specific implementation
  }
}

// Orchestrator
class PaymentOrchestrator {
  constructor(
    private providers: Map<string, IPaymentProvider>,
    private logger: ILogger,
    private metrics: IMetrics
  ) {}
  
  async processPayment(request: PaymentRequest): Promise<PaymentResult> {
    const provider = this.providers.get(request.provider);
    // Orchestration logic
  }
}
```

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for each provider with mocked dependencies
2. Unit tests for orchestrator with mocked providers
3. Integration tests with test payment provider
4. Contract tests for each real provider

## Notes
- Consider implementing circuit breaker pattern for provider failures
- Add comprehensive logging for payment audit trail
- Ensure PCI compliance is maintained throughout refactoring
- Create migration guide for team members
