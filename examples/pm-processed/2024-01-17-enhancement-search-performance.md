# Optimize Search Performance with Elasticsearch

## Summary
Replace the current PostgreSQL full-text search with Elasticsearch to improve search performance and provide better search features like fuzzy matching, faceted search, and auto-complete.

## Context
Current search implementation using PostgreSQL full-text search is becoming slow with our growing dataset (5M+ records). Users are experiencing 3-5 second search times, and we lack advanced features like typo tolerance and faceted filtering. Elasticsearch will provide sub-second search performance and enable advanced search features.

## Requirements
- Migrate search functionality from PostgreSQL to Elasticsearch
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing search API
- Implement fuzzy matching for typo tolerance
- Add faceted search capabilities
- Implement search-as-you-type functionality
- Set up data synchronization between PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch
- Ensure zero downtime during migration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Elasticsearch cluster is deployed and configured
- [ ] Search API response time is <200ms for 95th percentile
- [ ] Fuzzy matching handles 1-2 character typos
- [ ] Faceted search available for category, date range, and tags
- [ ] Auto-complete suggestions appear within 50ms of typing
- [ ] Data sync maintains <5 second lag between systems
- [ ] Search results relevance score improves by 25%
- [ ] Existing API contracts remain unchanged
- [ ] Full test coverage for new search implementation
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured for Elasticsearch
- [ ] Documentation updated with new architecture

## Technical Details
### Elasticsearch Configuration
```yaml
index_settings:
  number_of_shards: 3
  number_of_replicas: 2
  analysis:
    analyzer:
      custom_analyzer:
        type: custom
        tokenizer: standard
        filter:
          - lowercase
          - stop
          - snowball
          - edge_ngram
```

### Data Sync Strategy
1. Initial bulk import using Logstash
2. Real-time sync using Debezium CDC
3. Periodic reconciliation job for data integrity

### API Changes
- Internal implementation only
- Maintain existing endpoints:
  - `GET /api/search?q={query}`
  - `GET /api/search/suggestions?q={query}`
- Add new optional parameters:
  - `filters`: JSON object for faceted search
  - `fuzzy`: boolean to enable/disable fuzzy matching

### Performance Targets
- Search latency: <200ms (p95)
- Indexing latency: <100ms
- Query throughput: 1000 req/sec

## Notes
- Consider caching frequent queries in Redis
- Plan for Elasticsearch cluster scaling strategy
- Implement circuit breaker for fallback to PostgreSQL
- Monitor index size and implement retention policy
