# Fix Memory Leak in Dashboard Component

## Summary
The dashboard component is causing a memory leak that leads to performance degradation and eventual browser crashes after extended use.

## Context
Users have reported that the application becomes increasingly sluggish after 30-45 minutes of use. Browser memory profiling shows continuous memory growth in the dashboard component. The issue appears to be related to event listeners and interval timers not being properly cleaned up.

## Requirements
- Identify and fix all memory leaks in the dashboard component
- Ensure proper cleanup of event listeners and timers
- Verify fix with memory profiling tools
- Add preventive measures to avoid similar issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during extended dashboard use (1+ hour)
- [ ] All event listeners are properly removed on component unmount
- [ ] All timers/intervals are cleared on component unmount
- [ ] WebSocket connections are properly closed
- [ ] No console warnings about memory leaks in development mode
- [ ] Performance metrics show <5% memory growth over 1 hour
- [ ] Existing functionality remains intact

## Technical Details
### Suspected Issues
1. Chart library event listeners not being removed
2. WebSocket subscription not being unsubscribed
3. setInterval for data refresh not being cleared
4. Redux store subscriptions persisting after unmount

### Components to Review
- `/src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`
- `/src/components/Dashboard/RealtimeChart.jsx`
- `/src/components/Dashboard/MetricsPanel.jsx`
- `/src/hooks/useWebSocket.js`
- `/src/hooks/useDataRefresh.js`

### Testing Approach
1. Use Chrome DevTools Memory Profiler
2. Take heap snapshots before and after component mount/unmount cycles
3. Monitor memory usage over extended period
4. Use React DevTools Profiler to identify unnecessary re-renders

## Notes
- This issue is affecting ~15% of active users
- Temporary workaround: Users refreshing the page every 30 minutes
- Consider implementing a memory monitoring utility for development
