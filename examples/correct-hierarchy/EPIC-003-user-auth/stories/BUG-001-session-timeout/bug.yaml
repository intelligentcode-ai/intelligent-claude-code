description: |
  Users are being logged out after 5 minutes of inactivity instead
  of the configured 30 minutes. This is causing frustration and
  repeated login requirements.
  
reproduction_steps:
  - Login to application
  - Wait 5 minutes without activity
  - Try to access protected resource
  - Observe: 401 Unauthorized response
  
expected_behavior: |
  Session should remain valid for 30 minutes of inactivity as configured
  
actual_behavior: |
  Session expires after 5 minutes of inactivity
  
impact:
  affected_users: "All authenticated users"
  frequency: "100% reproducible"
  business_impact: "High - user frustration, productivity loss"
  
root_cause_analysis: |
  Initial investigation suggests token expiry is set correctly but
  the session validation middleware may be checking the wrong field.
