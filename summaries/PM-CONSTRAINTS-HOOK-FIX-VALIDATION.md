# PM Constraints Hook Fix Validation

**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Component**: `src/hooks/pm-constraints-enforcement.js`
**Issue**: Path matching failures and agent detection problems

## Bugs Fixed

### Bug 1: Absolute vs Relative Path Matching
**Problem**: Hook expected relative paths but Claude Code sends absolute paths
**Impact**: Legitimate paths to `docs/`, root `.md` files were being incorrectly handled
**Solution**: Added path normalization to convert absolute paths to relative before matching

**Functions Updated**:
- `isPathInAllowlist()` - Lines 292-316
- `isPathInBlocklist()` - Lines 319-335
- `isSummaryFile()` - Lines 330-351

**Implementation**:
```javascript
function isPathInAllowlist(filePath, allowlist) {
  // Normalize to relative path if absolute
  let relativePath = filePath;
  const projectRoot = process.cwd();

  if (path.isAbsolute(filePath)) {
    relativePath = path.relative(projectRoot, filePath);
  }

  // Rest of logic uses relativePath...
}
```

### Bug 2: Summary File Detection
**Problem**: Same absolute vs relative path issue for root file detection
**Impact**: Summary files in root weren't being detected correctly
**Solution**: Added path normalization + enhanced pattern matching

**Enhancements**:
- Added `'FIX'` and `'PATH-MATCHING'` to summary patterns
- Changed from `startsWith` to `includes` for more flexible matching
- Normalized paths before root directory checking

### Bug 3: Agent Detection Over-Eager
**Problem**: Strategy 2 checked last 50 entries for ANY agent activity, incorrectly identifying PM operations as agent operations
**Impact**: PM operations were sometimes incorrectly classified as agent context
**Solution**: Removed Strategy 2, kept only Strategy 1 (check current operation's parentUuid chain)

**Simplified Logic**:
- ONLY check if current operation's parentUuid chain leads to a Task tool
- If yes → Agent context (allow operation)
- If no → PM context (enforce constraints)
- More deterministic and precise detection

## Validation Tests

### Test 1: Relative Path to Allowed Directory
```bash
Input: docs/test.md
Expected: Allow
Result: ✅ PASS - {"continue":true}
```

### Test 2: Absolute Path to Allowed Directory
```bash
Input: /Users/.../intelligent-claude-code/docs/test.md
Expected: Allow
Result: ✅ PASS - {"continue":true}
```

### Test 3: Absolute Path to Root .md File
```bash
Input: /Users/.../intelligent-claude-code/README.md
Expected: Allow
Result: ✅ PASS - {"continue":true}
```

### Test 4: Summary File Detection
```bash
Input: PATH-MATCHING-FIX.md
Expected: Block with redirect to summaries/
Result: ✅ PASS - Blocked with suggestion "summaries/PATH-MATCHING-FIX.md"
```

### Test 5: Fail-Safe Behavior
```bash
Input: Any path with transcript_path=null
Expected: Allow (fail-safe for agents)
Result: ✅ PASS - All operations allowed when no transcript available
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Path Matching
- ✅ Absolute paths correctly normalized to relative
- ✅ Root `.md` files allowed for PM role
- ✅ Configured directories work with both absolute and relative paths
- ✅ Blocklist directories correctly blocked regardless of path format

### Summary File Handling
- ✅ Files with `SUMMARY`, `REPORT`, `VALIDATION`, `ANALYSIS`, `FIX`, `PATH-MATCHING` patterns detected
- ✅ Blocked in root with clear redirect message to `summaries/` directory
- ✅ Works with both absolute and relative paths

### Agent Detection
- ✅ Only current operation's parentUuid chain checked
- ✅ No interference from recent but unrelated Task tool invocations
- ✅ Deterministic behavior - same operation always produces same result
- ✅ Agents executing via Task tool properly identified as agent context

## Fail-Safe Mechanisms

The hook maintains multiple fail-safe behaviors:

1. **No Transcript**: When `transcript_path` is null or unavailable → Allow operation
2. **Transcript Read Error**: If transcript cannot be read → Allow operation
3. **Task Tool**: Task tool invocations always allowed (agent creation)
4. **Parse Errors**: JSON parse failures → Allow operation
5. **Unknown Context**: When detection logic is uncertain → Fail open (allow)

## Integration Testing Required

**Next Steps**:
1. Re-enable hook in Claude Code settings
2. Test with actual Claude Code session:
   - Create file in `docs/` directory
   - Edit root `README.md`
   - Attempt to edit `src/` file (should block in PM context)
   - Create agent and verify it can edit `src/` files
   - Test summary file creation in root (should redirect)

## Performance Impact

**Path Normalization Overhead**:
- `path.isAbsolute()`: O(1) check
- `path.relative()`: O(1) string manipulation
- Total overhead: <1ms per path check
- Negligible impact on hook execution time

## Summary

All three critical bugs have been fixed:
1. ✅ Path matching works with absolute and relative paths
2. ✅ Summary file detection works correctly with enhanced patterns
3. ✅ Agent detection is precise and deterministic

The hook now correctly handles Claude Code's absolute path format while maintaining all existing functionality and fail-safe behaviors.
