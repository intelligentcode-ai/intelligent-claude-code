**Key Findings**:
- 9 enforcement hooks operational with comprehensive coverage
- PM role constraints fully enforced via code (no markdown needed)
- Git privacy automatically enforced (configuration-driven)
- Project scope protection prevents installation path modification
- Agent context detection enables PM vs Agent operation differentiation
- Summary file organization enforced by configuration
