# Fix: Duplicate Summary Validation Logic Across Hooks

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Version**: v8.20.0
**Issue**: Duplicate summary validation logic in two hooks causing DRY violation

## Problem Statement

Summary file validation logic was **DUPLICATED** in two separate hooks:
1. `summary-file-enforcement.js` (lines 60-110)
2. `pm-constraints-enforcement.js` (lines 538-596)

This violated the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and created maintenance issues where changes to validation logic had to be made in multiple places.

## Solution Implemented

### Shared Library Pattern

Created centralized validation library at:
```
src/hooks/lib/summary-validation.js
```

**Exported Functions**:
- `isSummaryFile(filePath, projectRoot)` - Check if file matches summary patterns
- `validateSummaryFilePlacement(filePath, projectRoot)` - Validate summary file location

### Validation Logic

The shared library implements a three-step validation process:

**Step 1: Directory Exclusions (Highest Priority)**
- Exclude files in: `stories/`, `bugs/`, `docs/`, `agenttasks/`, `src/`, `tests/`, `config/`
- These directories have their own file type rules

**Step 2: Root Directory Special Files**
- Allow well-known root files: `VERSION`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`, etc.
- Allow configuration files: `icc.config.json`, `icc.workflow.json`

**Step 3: Summary Pattern Matching**
- Check filename against patterns: `/summary/i`, `/report/i`, `/fix/i`, `/analysis/i`, `/review/i`, `/assessment/i`, etc.
- If matches and NOT in `summaries/` directory → Block with guidance

### Hook Updates

**summary-file-enforcement.js**:
- Added import: `const { validateSummaryFilePlacement } = require('./lib/summary-validation');`
- Replaced lines 60-110 with shared library call
- Maintained ALL-CAPITALS validation logic (separate concern)

**pm-constraints-enforcement.js**:
- Added import: `const { validateSummaryFilePlacement } = require('./lib/summary-validation');`
- Removed duplicate functions: `isSummaryFile()` and `validateSummaryFile()`
- Updated call on line 1009 to use shared library

## Validation Testing

Tested the shared library with multiple scenarios:

```
✓ Test 1: stories/STORY-001-validation-fix.md → Allowed (in stories/)
✓ Test 2: hook-summary.md (root) → Blocked (summary in root)
✓ Test 3: summaries/hook-summary.md → Allowed (correct location)
✓ Test 4: README.md (root) → Allowed (well-known file)
✓ Test 5: analysis-report.md (root) → Blocked (summary in root)
```

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Validation logic exists in ONE place
2. **Maintainability**: Changes only need to be made once
3. **Consistency**: Both hooks use identical validation logic
4. **Testability**: Shared library can be tested independently
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new summary patterns or exclusions

## Files Modified

1. `src/hooks/lib/summary-validation.js` - Created (100 lines)
2. `src/hooks/summary-file-enforcement.js` - Updated to use shared library
3. `src/hooks/pm-constraints-enforcement.js` - Updated to use shared library

## Success Criteria Met

- ✅ Shared library created with ALL summary validation logic
- ✅ Both hooks import and use shared library
- ✅ NO duplicate code remains
- ✅ STORY files with "validation", "analysis" etc. work correctly (directory exclusion)
- ✅ Summary files properly redirected to summaries/ directory
- ✅ Well-known root files allowed (README.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.)

## Technical Architecture

```
src/hooks/
├── lib/
│   ├── summary-validation.js    ← New shared library
│   ├── config-loader.js          ← Used by shared library
│   └── [other libs]
├── summary-file-enforcement.js   ← Uses shared library
└── pm-constraints-enforcement.js ← Uses shared library
```

## Code Quality Impact

**Before**:
- 2 separate implementations (≈120 lines duplicated)
- Inconsistent validation logic
- High maintenance burden

**After**:
- 1 shared implementation (100 lines)
- Consistent validation across hooks
- DRY principle satisfied
- Better code organization

## Next Steps

No further action required. The fix is complete and working correctly.
