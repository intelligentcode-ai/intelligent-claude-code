# Project Context - Intelligent Claude Code

## CRITICAL NATURE OF THIS PROJECT

**This is a MARKDOWN-based behavioral system for AI-agentic virtual teams**

### What This System IS:
- Behavioral patterns written in Markdown
- Guidance for AI agents working in Claude Code
- Instructions for how AI teams should operate
- Generic system applicable to ANY project type

### What This System IS NOT:
- NOT executable code
- NOT a program
- NOT limited to self-development
- NOT testable before deployment

### Work Constraints:
- ALL work happens in src/ directory ONLY
- Deployment is USER responsibility ONLY
- NO testing - only activation after deployment
- Changes apply ONLY after user deploys

### Key Understanding:
The behavioral system being created here can guide AI teams to work on:
- Software development projects
- Documentation projects  
- Research projects
- ANY type of project

The fact that THIS project is creating that system does NOT mean the system should be self-referential or limited to creating behavioral systems.

## Current Critical Issues

- BUG-073: Commands use wrong parameter format (BLOCKING ALL FUNCTIONALITY)
- BUG-074: Pseudo-code contamination (BEHAVIORS UNREADABLE)
- BUG-075: Workflows not integrated (EXECUTION BROKEN)
- BUG-076: Still using MCP Memory instead of file-based
- BUG-079: Configuration hardcoded (SETTINGS IGNORED)
- BUG-080: Task ordering wrong (WORKFLOWS VIOLATED)

## Reminder for All Work

ALWAYS REMEMBER:
1. You're creating BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS, not code
2. Work ONLY in src/ directory
3. User deploys, you don't
4. This system guides AI agents, it doesn't execute
