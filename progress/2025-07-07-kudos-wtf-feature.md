# Progress Report: Kudos/WTF Feature Implementation

**Date:** 2025-07-07 15:42:07  
**PM:** @PM  
**Project:** Implement Kudos/WTF Team Recognition and Penalty System

## Objective
Implement a Kudos/WTF system that allows users and authorized team members to provide enhanced recognition or penalties with double scoring effects, including team learning mechanisms.

## Team Assignments
- **Requirements Analysis:** @Requirements-Engineer (pending)
- **Architecture Design:** @Architect (pending)  
- **Implementation:** @AI-Engineer (pending)
- **Peer Review:** TBD (pending)
- **DoD Validation:** @QA-Engineer (pending)
- **Documentation Updates:** @Documentation-Specialist (pending)

## Feature Requirements (Initial)

### Core Functionality
- **Kudos:** Double positive points for exceptional performance
- **WTF:** Double negative points for significant errors/violations
- **Learning Integration:** Team adjusts behavior based on Kudos/WTF patterns

### Authorization Matrix
- **User:** Full authority for Kudos/WTF on any team member
- **PM + Architect:** Joint authority (both must agree), cannot target themselves, User veto right
- **Other Team Members:** Nomination only with justification, PM+Architect approval required, User veto right

### Enforcement
- **Misuse Penalty:** Double WTF points for any authorization violations
- **Veto Authority:** User maintains ultimate veto power over all Kudos/WTF decisions

## Process Compliance
- ✅ Progress tracking file created with system timestamp
- ✅ Following Requirements → Architecture → Implementation → Review → DoD workflow
- ✅ All roles will display scores and request proper peer review
- ✅ Todo list updated with complete workflow tasks
