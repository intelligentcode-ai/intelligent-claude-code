# BUG-017: Error Forgiveness Concept Incompatible with PRB System

## Problem
The system includes "error forgiveness" and penalty concepts that are incompatible with a PRB-driven execution model. PRBs are designed for single-pass execution with complete context, making error forgiveness unnecessary and confusing.

## Impact
- Conceptual confusion about system operation
- Unnecessary complexity in behavioral patterns
- Conflicts with PRB-driven execution model

## Expected Behavior
- Learning system captures patterns from PRB execution
- No error forgiveness or penalty mechanisms
- Focus on successful PRB completion patterns
- Memory captures learnings without error counting

## Current Issues
- learning-team-automation.md contains error forgiveness logic
- shared-patterns/learning-patterns.md has penalty system
- References to "first error forgiven" throughout behaviors

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Error forgiveness concept completely removed
- [ ] Penalty system eliminated
- [ ] Learning system remains functional
- [ ] Clear focus on PRB-driven execution
