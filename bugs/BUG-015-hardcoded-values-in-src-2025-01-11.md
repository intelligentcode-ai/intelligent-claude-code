# BUG-015: Hardcoded Values in src/

## Problem
The src/ directory contains hardcoded paths, user-specific references, and project-specific values that prevent the system from being universal. The behavioral patterns and commands should work in any project directory, not just this specific installation.

## Impact
- System cannot be deployed to other users' machines
- Behaviors fail when project is in different directory
- Commands have hardcoded paths that don't work universally

## Expected Behavior
- All behavioral patterns work regardless of project location
- Commands detect project context dynamically
- No user-specific paths in the system
- System initializes from any directory

## Reproduction Steps
1. Try to use the system in a different project directory
2. Observe failures due to hardcoded paths
3. Check src/ files for /Users/ksamaschke references

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No hardcoded absolute paths in src/
- [ ] Commands work from any project directory
- [ ] Behaviors adapt to project structure dynamically
- [ ] System remains fully markdown-based
