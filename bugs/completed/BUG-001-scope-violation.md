# BUG-001: System Exceeds Scope of Project

**Status:** Completed
**Completion Date:** 2025-01-09
**Fixed In:** PR #53  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Reported:** 2025-01-09  
**Reporter:** User  

## Summary
The system attempts to write to the `~/.claude` directory, which violates strict project scope boundaries. This directory must be completely out of scope for all write operations except for two specific cases.

## Description
The intelligent-claude-code system is attempting to perform write operations to the `~/.claude` directory during normal operation. This is a critical scope violation as the `~/.claude` directory should be strictly off-limits for write operations.

### Allowed Operations
- **Reading:** Permitted for loading system configuration and behavioral patterns
- **Writing:** ONLY permitted in these two specific cases:
  1. Installation via Makefile and Ansible (when installing this specific project)
  2. Global configuration changes explicitly requested by the user

### Current Behavior
The system is attempting to write to `~/.claude` outside of these permitted cases.

### Expected Behavior
The system should:
1. Never write to `~/.claude` during normal project operations
2. Keep all project-specific data within the project directory
3. Only read from `~/.claude` for configuration loading
4. Only write to `~/.claude` during installation or explicit global config changes

## Impact
- **Security:** Potential contamination of global configuration
- **Isolation:** Breaks project isolation principles
- **Compliance:** Violates strict scope boundaries defined for the system

## Reproduction Steps
1. Execute any PRB or work request
2. Monitor file system operations
3. Observe unauthorized write attempts to `~/.claude`

## Root Cause Analysis
The system's behavioral patterns and enforcement mechanisms are not properly enforcing project scope boundaries. The following components need review:
- PRB execution behavior
- Task tool invocation patterns
- Memory storage operations
- Configuration updates

## Proposed Solution
1. Implement strict scope validation in `prb-enforcement.md`
2. Add pre-execution validation for all file operations
3. Block any Task tool invocations with `~/.claude` in the working directory
4. Add monitoring and alerting for scope violations
5. Update all behavioral patterns to respect project boundaries

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No write operations to `~/.claude` during normal execution
- [ ] All project data stays within project directory
- [ ] Installation process still works correctly
- [ ] Global config changes (when explicitly requested) still work
- [ ] Scope validation prevents violations before they occur
- [ ] Clear error messages when scope violations are attempted
