# BUG-007: icc-init-system Fails to Reload Behaviors, Templates, and Scope in Established Context

**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Reported:** 2025-08-09  
**Reporter:** User  

## Summary
The `/icc-init-system` command FAILS to reload ALL behaviors, PRB templates, and project scope when run in an already established context. It only performs these critical loads at session start, causing system drift and fundamental misunderstanding of the project nature.

## Description
When `/icc-init-system` is run in an ongoing session, it CRITICALLY FAILS to:
1. **Reload ALL behaviors** from src/behaviors/ 
2. **Reload ALL PRB templates** from prb-templates/
3. **Refresh project scope understanding**
4. **Re-establish system nature** as MARKDOWN-BASED AI-AGENTIC SYSTEM

This causes the system to operate on stale or incomplete understanding, leading to fundamental errors in work execution.

### Current Behavior (WRONG)
- Shows configuration loaded (but doesn't actually reload behaviors)
- Shows memory system operational (but doesn't reload patterns)
- Shows virtual team ready (but doesn't refresh their instructions)
- Shows work status (but doesn't understand what kind of work)
- **MISSING:** Behavior reloading
- **MISSING:** Template reloading  
- **MISSING:** Project scope clarification
- **MISSING:** System nature reinforcement

### Expected Behavior (CORRECT)
```
## ðŸ”„ Reloading System Components
âœ… Loading ALL behaviors from src/behaviors/...
  - prb-execution.md
  - prb-enforcement.md
  - prb-auto-trigger.md
  - proactive-memory-behavior.md
  - [... ALL behaviors listed]
âœ… Loading ALL PRB templates...
  - nano-prb-template.yaml
  - tiny-prb-template.yaml
  - medium-prb-template.yaml
  - large-prb-template.yaml
  - mega-prb-template.yaml
âœ… Refreshing project scope...

## ðŸ“‹ Project Scope Reminder
**System Nature:** MARKDOWN-BASED AI-AGENTIC SYSTEM
**Purpose:** AI instruction framework for virtual team coordination
**NOT:** Software development or code implementation
**Focus:** Writing behavioral instructions for AI agents
```

## Impact
- **CRITICAL**: System doesn't understand it's an AI instruction framework
- **CRITICAL**: PM + Architect collaboration produces wrong role assignments
- **HIGH**: Causes PRBs to be created with code-development mindset
- **HIGH**: Results in confusion about what the system actually does
- **MEDIUM**: Time estimations added when they don't apply to AI instructions

## Root Cause
The `/icc-init-system` command focuses on technical initialization but doesn't reinforce the fundamental understanding of WHAT the project is. This is especially critical in established contexts where the AI might drift from the correct understanding.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Start a session
2. Work on several tasks
3. Run `/icc-init-system`
4. Observe that project scope is not clarified
5. Notice subsequent PRBs have wrong role assignments and approach

## Evidence
- STORY-005 PRB created with @Developer instead of @AI-Engineer
- PRB included time estimations (meaningless for AI instructions)
- PRB wanted to create NEW behaviors instead of modifying existing ones
- PRB focused only on bugs, missing EPICs and STORYs

## Proposed Solution
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Add project scope reminder to `/icc-init-system` output
2. **ENHANCE**: Make scope reminder PROMINENT and UNMISSABLE
3. **VALIDATE**: Check that AI understands system nature after init
4. **ENFORCE**: Block PRB creation if system nature misunderstood

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `/icc-init-system` ALWAYS displays project scope
- [ ] Scope reminder is PROMINENT in output
- [ ] System nature clearly stated: MARKDOWN-BASED AI-AGENTIC
- [ ] Purpose clarified: AI instructions, not code
- [ ] Subsequent PRBs have correct role assignments
- [ ] No code-development terminology in PRBs

## Related Issues
- Incorrect PRB generation patterns
- Role assignment violations
- System nature confusion

## Priority Justification
HIGH priority because this confusion cascades into all subsequent work, causing systemic issues with PRB generation, role assignment, and fundamental misunderstanding of the project's purpose.
