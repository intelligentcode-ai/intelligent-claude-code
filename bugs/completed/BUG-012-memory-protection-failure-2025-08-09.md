# BUG-012: Memory Protection Workflow Not Preventing Commits

**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Reported:** 2025-08-09  
**Reporter:** User  

## Summary
The GitHub workflow for memory protection is running but not PREVENTING memory files from being committed. It only fails AFTER the push is accepted.

## Description
The `.github/workflows/memory-check.yml` workflow correctly detects memory files but:
1. It runs AFTER push to main is accepted
2. Direct pushes to main bypass the protection
3. No pre-commit hook exists to catch this locally
4. The workflow can't reject pushes, only fail after

## Evidence
- Workflow runs show failures when memory was committed
- But the commits were still accepted into main
- Memory file was successfully pushed before being caught

## Current Behavior
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
```
This only runs AFTER the push succeeds.

## Expected Behavior
1. Local pre-commit hook prevents memory commits
2. Branch protection requires PR reviews
3. Workflow blocks PR merges with memory files
4. Multiple layers of protection

## Impact
- **CRITICAL**: Memory files can be accidentally exposed
- **CRITICAL**: Private learnings could become public
- **HIGH**: Violates memory privacy principle

## Proposed Solution
1. Create `.githooks/pre-commit` script
2. Update workflow to run on ALL branches
3. Add branch protection rules (manual GitHub setup)
4. Add pre-push hook as backup

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Pre-commit hook blocks memory file commits locally
- [ ] Workflow runs on all branches, not just main
- [ ] Clear error messages at every protection layer
- [ ] Documentation on setting up local hooks
- [ ] Memory files cannot reach GitHub
