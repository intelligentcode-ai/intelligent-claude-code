# BUG-010: CHANGELOG not being updated before creating PRs

**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Date Reported:** 2025-08-09  
**Category:** Process/Documentation  

## Current Behavior

The CHANGELOG.md file is not being updated with version bumps and release notes before creating PRs. The changelog is either:
- Updated after PR creation (sometimes)
- Updated after merge/release
- Not updated at all, leaving releases with missing entries

## Expected Behavior

CHANGELOG.md should be updated with version bump and release notes as part of the commit process, before PR creation. This ensures:
- All PRs contain complete documentation of changes
- Release notes are available during review process
- No releases ship with outdated or missing changelog entries

## Impact

**Documentation Quality:**
- Releases have incomplete or missing changelog entries
- Review process lacks visibility into documented changes
- Release documentation becomes inconsistent
- Users cannot track changes properly between versions

**Process Quality:**
- PRs are created without proper documentation
- Release notes are treated as afterthought rather than integral part
- Version history becomes fragmented and unclear

## Evidence

**Recent Examples:**
- CHANGELOG.md shows version 6.8.3 but may have been updated post-PR
- Pattern suggests changelog updates happen after rather than before PR creation
- Release documentation workflow not integrated with PR creation process

**Current CHANGELOG Status:**
- File exists at: `/Users/ksamaschke/Work/Engineering/intelligent-claude-code/CHANGELOG.md`
- Format follows Keep a Changelog standard
- Contains detailed entries but timing of updates unclear
- Most recent entry: 6.8.3 - 2025-08-09 (Security release)

## Suggested Solution Areas

**Process Integration:**
- Include CHANGELOG.md update in PRB templates
- Add changelog validation to PR creation workflow
- Ensure version bump includes changelog update
- Make changelog update mandatory before git operations

**Workflow Enhancement:**
- Version bump should automatically prompt for changelog entry
- PRB execution should validate changelog is current
- Git operations should check for changelog consistency
- PR templates could include changelog verification

**Quality Gates:**
- Validate changelog entry exists for version being released
- Check that changelog reflects actual changes being made
- Ensure changelog follows Keep a Changelog format
- Verify changelog is updated before PR, not after

## Success Criteria

- All PRs include updated CHANGELOG.md with relevant entries
- Version bumps automatically include changelog updates  
- No releases ship without proper changelog documentation
- Changelog updates happen before PR creation, not after
- Release documentation is complete and available during review process
