# TASK-003: [QA-Engineer] Test and validate file-based memory system

## Task Details
- **Task ID**: TASK-003
- **Parent**: BUG-121
- **Title**: [QA-Engineer] Test and validate file-based memory system
- **Status**: PLANNED
- **Priority**: P1
- **Assignee**: @QA-Engineer
- **SME_Reviewer**: @AI-Engineer
- **Created**: 2025-01-23
- **Updated**: 2025-01-23

## Description
Comprehensive testing of the new file-based memory implementation to ensure it works correctly and that no MCP memory operations remain in the system.

## Objectives
1. Test all memory operation functions
2. Validate learning capture works correctly
3. Ensure no MCP memory references remain
4. Verify performance is acceptable

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create test scenarios for memory operations
- [ ] Test learning storage and retrieval
- [ ] Scan codebase for remaining MCP references
- [ ] Performance test file-based operations

## Test Scenarios
1. **Storage Tests**
   - Store new learning entity
   - Store duplicate entity (should update)
   - Store with invalid data (should error)
   - Store multiple entity types

2. **Search Tests**
   - Search by keyword in content
   - Search by entity type
   - Search by date range
   - Search non-existent patterns

3. **Load Tests**
   - Load existing entity
   - Load non-existent entity
   - Load corrupted file
   - Load with relationships

4. **Integration Tests**
   - Full workflow with memory operations
   - Learning capture during retrospective
   - Memory search before task execution
   - Cross-entity relationships

## Validation Checks
```bash
# No MCP memory references
grep -r "mcp__memory" src/
grep -r "create_entities" src/
grep -r "search_nodes" src/

# File structure exists
ls -la .claude/memory/entities/
ls -la .claude/memory/index/

# Learning files created
find .claude/memory -name "*.md" -type f
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All test scenarios pass
- [ ] Zero MCP memory references found
- [ ] Learning files created correctly
- [ ] Search returns accurate results
- [ ] Performance under 1 second for searches

## Notes
- Work with AI-Engineer on any fixes needed
- Document any edge cases discovered
- Create regression tests for future
