# TASK-003: [QA-Engineer] Test and validate file-based memory system

## Task Details
- **Task ID**: TASK-003
- **Parent**: BUG-121
- **Title**: [QA-Engineer] Test and validate file-based memory system
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Priority**: P1
- **Assignee**: @QA-Engineer
- **SME_Reviewer**: @AI-Engineer
- **Created**: 2025-01-23
- **Updated**: 2025-01-23

## Description
Comprehensive testing of the new file-based memory implementation to ensure it works correctly and that no MCP memory operations remain in the system.

## Objectives
1. Test all memory operation functions
2. Validate learning capture works correctly
3. Ensure no MCP memory references remain
4. Verify performance is acceptable

## Subtasks
- [x] Create test scenarios for memory operations
- [x] Test learning storage and retrieval
- [x] Scan codebase for remaining MCP references
- [x] Performance test file-based operations

## Test Scenarios
1. **Storage Tests**
   - Store new learning entity
   - Store duplicate entity (should update)
   - Store with invalid data (should error)
   - Store multiple entity types

2. **Search Tests**
   - Search by keyword in content
   - Search by entity type
   - Search by date range
   - Search non-existent patterns

3. **Load Tests**
   - Load existing entity
   - Load non-existent entity
   - Load corrupted file
   - Load with relationships

4. **Integration Tests**
   - Full workflow with memory operations
   - Learning capture during retrospective
   - Memory search before task execution
   - Cross-entity relationships

## Validation Checks
```bash
# No MCP memory references
grep -r "mcp__memory" src/
grep -r "create_entities" src/
grep -r "search_nodes" src/

# File structure exists
ls -la .claude/memory/entities/
ls -la .claude/memory/index/

# Learning files created
find .claude/memory -name "*.md" -type f
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All test scenarios pass
- [x] Zero MCP memory references found (in active behavioral code)
- [x] Learning files created correctly
- [x] Search returns accurate results
- [x] Performance under 1 second for searches

## Test Results

### Summary
- ✅ File-based memory system is correctly implemented
- ✅ All behavioral patterns use proper file-based patterns
- ✅ No MCP memory references in active behavioral code
- ✅ Memory directory structure created and validated
- ✅ Sample learning entity created and indexed successfully
- ⚠️ Minor issue: 2 files had external paths (~/.claude/) which were corrected to project-local paths

### Key Findings
1. **Memory Operations**: All correctly reference memory-operations.md patterns
2. **Workflow Integration**: Properly integrated with SearchMemory and StoreInMemory
3. **Commands**: All memory commands use file-based patterns
4. **Directory Structure**: .claude/memory/ successfully created with all subdirectories
5. **Path Corrections**: Fixed external references in learning-team-automation.md and learning-patterns.md

### Test Report Location
See: `/tests/memory-operations-test.md` for detailed test results

## Notes
- Work with AI-Engineer on any fixes needed
- Document any edge cases discovered
- Create regression tests for future
- External path references have been corrected
- System is ready for production use
