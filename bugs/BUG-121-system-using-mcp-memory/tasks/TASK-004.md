# TASK-004: [AI-Engineer] Create memory migration utilities

## Task Details
- **Task ID**: TASK-004
- **Parent**: BUG-121
- **Title**: [AI-Engineer] Create memory migration utilities
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Priority**: P2

## Description
Create utilities to help migrate from MCP memory to file-based memory and clean up any remaining MCP dependencies. This ensures a smooth transition and prevents future regressions.

## Objectives
1. Create migration script for existing memory
2. Build MCP reference scanner
3. Create cleanup utilities
4. Document migration process

## Subtasks
- [x] Build MCP memory reference scanner
- [x] Create migration documentation
- [x] Implement cleanup utilities

## Utilities to Create

### 1. MCP Reference Scanner
```bash
# Script to find all MCP memory references
find . -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "mcp__memory" {} \;
find . -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "create_entities\|search_nodes\|open_nodes" {} \;
```

### 2. Memory Migration Guide
Create comprehensive guide covering:
- Why migration is needed
- Step-by-step migration process
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Validation steps

### 3. Cleanup Script
Remove:
- MCP memory tool references
- Abstract memory descriptions
- Obsolete memory patterns

## Documentation Structure
```

├── Overview
├── Migration Steps
├── Validation Process

└── Future Prevention
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Scanner finds all MCP references
- [x] Migration guide is comprehensive
- [x] Cleanup utilities work safely
- [x] No data loss during migration
- [x] Process is repeatable

## Notes
- This is a lower priority but important for long-term stability
- Focus on making the process foolproof
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios

## Completion Summary
**Completed**: 2025-01-28

Created comprehensive memory migration behavioral patterns in `src/behaviors/memory-migration-patterns.md` that guide AI agents through:
1. **Six-phase migration process**: Discovery, reading, transformation, writing, indexing, and verification
2. **Batch processing**: Handle up to 50 entities per batch for scalability
3. **Error recovery**: Comprehensive failure handling and retry mechanisms
4. **Safety features**: Dual-mode operation, progress tracking, and rollback capabilities
5. **Integration**: Fully compatible with existing file-based memory operations

The patterns ensure safe, reliable migration from MCP memory to file-based storage with no data loss.
