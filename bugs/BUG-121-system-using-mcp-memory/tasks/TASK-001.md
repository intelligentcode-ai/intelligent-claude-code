- **Status**: COMPLETED

## Description
Implement the core file-based memory operation functions to replace MCP memory usage. These functions must handle all memory operations using markdown files within the project's .claude/memory/ directory.

## Objectives
1. Create StoreInMemory function for saving entities
2. Create SearchMemory function for finding entities
3. Create LoadFromMemory function for retrieving entities
4. Implement proper file structure and indexing

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design file-based memory structure and naming conventions
- [ ] Implement StoreInMemory with entity type support
- [ ] Implement SearchMemory with pattern matching
- [ ] Implement LoadFromMemory with error handling

## Technical Requirements
- Use .claude/memory/ directory within project (NOT ~/.claude)
- Support all entity types (Learning, Pattern, Knowledge, etc.)
- Use markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- Implement date-based directory structure for organization
- Include proper error handling and validation

## File Structure
```
.claude/memory/
├── entities/
│   ├── Learning/
│   │   └── 2025/
│   │       └── 01/
│   │           └── Learning-[Type]-[ID].md
│   ├── Pattern/
│   └── Knowledge/
├── index/
│   └── entity-index.md
└── relationships/
    └── entity-relationships.md
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All functions work with file-based storage
- [ ] No MCP memory references in implementation
- [ ] Proper error handling for file operations
- [ ] Entity indexing for fast searches
- [ ] Works within project directory only

## Notes
- This is the foundation for fixing the memory system
- Must be compatible with existing behavioral patterns
- Performance is important but correctness is critical
