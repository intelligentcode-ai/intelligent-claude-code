title: System using MCP memory instead of file-based memory
description: |
  The system is incorrectly using MCP memory operations instead of the file-based memory 
  system that was designed for the intelligent-claude-code project. This causes:
  - Memory not being persisted correctly
  - Learnings not being stored in the expected file structure
  - Violations of the file-based architecture
  
status: PLANNED
priority: P0
severity: CRITICAL
category: memory-system
assigned_to: "@AI-Engineer"
reporter: "@User"
created_date: 2025-01-23
updated_date: 2025-01-23

impact:
  - Memory operations fail silently
  - Learning capture doesn't work
  - System can't recall previous patterns
  - Workflow retrospectives don't store learnings

root_cause: |
  Behavioral patterns are referencing MCP memory operations instead of 
  using the file-based memory system defined in the architecture.

acceptance_criteria:
  - All MCP memory references removed from behavioral patterns
  - File-based memory operations used exclusively
  - Memory stored in .claude/memory/ within project
  - Learning capture works correctly
  - No external memory dependencies
