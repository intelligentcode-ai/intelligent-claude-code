# BUG-016: Code and Pseudo-code in Behavioral Patterns

## Problem
The src/ directory contains code blocks, pseudo-code, and programming constructs in what should be pure markdown behavioral descriptions. This violates the principle that this is a MARKDOWN-BASED AI-AGENTIC SYSTEM, not a code implementation.

## Impact
- Confusion about system nature (behavioral vs implementation)
- Inconsistent documentation format
- Mixing of concerns (behavior definition vs code)

## Expected Behavior
- All behaviors expressed as markdown documentation
- Logic described using bullet lists, tables, and text
- No code blocks or pseudo-code in src/
- Clear behavioral descriptions without programming constructs

## Found Patterns
- Function definitions (ValidateProjectScope, LoadTemplate, etc.)
- IF/THEN/ELSE pseudo-code blocks
- FOR loops and WHILE constructs
- RETURN statements and error codes
- Code examples in templates

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Zero code blocks in src/
- [ ] Zero pseudo-code patterns
- [ ] All logic expressed as markdown lists or tables
- [ ] Clear behavioral descriptions maintained
