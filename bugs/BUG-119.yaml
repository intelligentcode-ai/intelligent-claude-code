title: Excessive token usage in subagent execution
description: |
  Subagents are consuming ~40k tokens per execution due to inefficient behavioral patterns:
  - Reading entire files when only specific sections needed
  - Re-analyzing full context instead of receiving focused instructions
  - Not leveraging parent agent's existing analysis
  - Missing concise handoff patterns between parent and subagent

reproduction_steps:
  - Observe any subagent execution
  - Note token usage shows ~40k per subagent
  - Review subagent reads entire files unnecessarily
  - See subagent re-analyzes from scratch
acceptance_criteria:
  - Subagent token usage reduced by 80%
  - Parent provides focused context to subagents
  - Subagents receive specific line numbers/sections
  - Clear handoff patterns prevent re-analysis
