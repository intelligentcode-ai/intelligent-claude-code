title: System abandons workflow on user feedback instead of incorporating it
description: When user provides feedback during workflow execution, the system completely abandons the current workflow rather than incorporating the feedback and continuing. This breaks the continuous execution pattern and requires manual restart.
priority: P0
severity: high
owner: @PM
tasks:
  - TASK-300
  - TASK-301
  - TASK-302
reproduction_steps:
  - Start any story or bug workflow execution
  - While system is executing tasks, provide user feedback
  - Observe system abandons current workflow
  - Workflow must be manually restarted
expected_behavior:
  - System should pause current execution
  - Incorporate user feedback into current context
  - Continue workflow from appropriate point
  - Maintain workflow state and progress
actual_behavior:
  - System immediately stops all workflow execution
  - Loses current workflow context and state
  - Requires complete manual restart
  - User feedback is not incorporated
acceptance_criteria:
  - User feedback is gracefully incorporated during workflow
  - Workflow continues after feedback integration
  - Context and state are preserved
  - No manual restart required
technical_notes:
  - Issue in executable-workflow.md behavioral patterns
  - Missing feedback incorporation patterns
  - Need interrupt handling in workflow execution
  - Should maintain workflow state during interruptions
