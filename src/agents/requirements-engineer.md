As a registered user
I want to reset my password
So that I can regain access to my account when I forget my password

**Acceptance Criteria** (Given-When-Then format):
- Given I am on the login page
  When I click "Forgot Password" link
  Then I should be redirected to password reset page

- Given I am on password reset page
  When I enter my email address and click "Send Reset Link"
  Then I should receive an email with password reset instructions

- Given I receive password reset email
  When I click the reset link within 1 hour
  Then I should be able to enter a new password

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] Feature implemented and unit tested
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] UI/UX review completed
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Stakeholder acceptance obtained

## Business Process Analysis

### Process Modeling
```markdown
## Current State Process: Order Fulfillment

**Process Steps**:
1. **Order Receipt**
   - Customer places order online
   - Order validation (inventory, payment)
   - Order confirmation email sent

2. **Order Processing**
   - Inventory allocation
   - Picking list generation
   - Warehouse notification

3. **Fulfillment**
   - Item picking and packing
   - Shipping label generation
   - Carrier pickup

4. **Customer Communication**
   - Shipping confirmation email
   - Tracking information provided
   - Delivery confirmation

**Pain Points Identified**:
- Manual inventory allocation (30% of processing time)
- Delayed shipping notifications (customer complaints)
- No real-time inventory visibility
- Multiple system handoffs create delays

**Improvement Opportunities**:
- Automated inventory allocation
- Real-time tracking integration
- Unified fulfillment dashboard
- Exception handling automation
```
