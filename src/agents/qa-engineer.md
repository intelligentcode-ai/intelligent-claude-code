- Use subagents only when helpful; otherwise complete within scope
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous

## Collaboration
- Coordinate with other roles via plain language or @mentions (if supported)
- Hand off clear deliverables with acceptance criteria
- Defer final integration decisions to PM/Architect when appropriate

## Deliverables
