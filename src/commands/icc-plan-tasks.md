# Plan Tasks

Create individual task files using $ARGUMENTS as story/bug ID.

## Behavioral Sequence
1. Verify current role is Specialist-Architect:
   - Must be @AI-Architect, @System-Architect, @Security-Architect, etc.
   - If not specialist architect, respond "Error: Task planning requires Specialist-Architect role. Current: [current_role]"
2. Parse $ARGUMENTS to extract item ID (STORY-XXX or BUG-XXX format)
3. If item ID missing, respond "Error: Item ID required (format: STORY-XXX or BUG-XXX)"
4. Validate item exists and is ready for task planning:
   - Locate item file based on type
   - If not found, respond "Error: Item [ITEM-ID] not found"
   - Load item YAML and verify phase is PLANNING
   - Verify planning order exists (from icc-plan-order)
5. If item not ready:
   - Respond "Error: Item must be in PLANNING phase with planning order. Current: [phase]"
6. Load planning context:
   - Read planning order document
   - Review dependencies and constraints
   - Load similar patterns from memory
   - Apply specialist architect domain expertise
7. Generate comprehensive task breakdown using standardized numbering:
   
   **Process Tasks (001-009):**
   - TASK-001: Knowledge Loading (search memory, load context)
   - TASK-002: Dependency Resolution (resolve external dependencies)
   - TASK-003: Environment Setup (prepare tools, access, etc.)
   
   **Core Work Tasks (010-994):**
   - TASK-010: Analysis/Investigation (understand requirements)
   - TASK-020: Design/Architecture (create technical design)
   - TASK-030: Implementation (core development work)
   - TASK-040: Integration (connect with existing systems)
   - TASK-050: Configuration (setup and configuration)
   - TASK-060: Additional implementation tasks as needed
   
   **Quality Assurance (Auto-generated):**
   - TASK-[X+1]: Peer Review (for each implementation task)
   - Domain expert review by appropriate specialist
   
   **Wrap-up Tasks (995-999):**
   - TASK-995: Documentation (update docs, comments)
   - TASK-996: Testing Validation (verify all tests pass)
   - TASK-997: Git Operations (commit, push, PR)
   - TASK-998: Knowledge Creation (capture learnings)
   - TASK-999: Completion Verification (validate done)

8. Apply domain-specific task patterns:
   
   **AI/ML Work:**
   - Data preparation and validation tasks
   - Model training and optimization tasks
   - Behavioral pattern implementation
   - AI system integration tasks
   
   **Infrastructure Work:**
   - Environment provisioning tasks
   - Deployment pipeline setup
   - Monitoring and logging configuration
   - Security and compliance validation
   
   **Frontend Work:**
   - Component design and implementation
   - User experience validation
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Accessibility compliance

9. Validate specialist assignments for each task:
   - Execute `icc-validate-work-type` for each task
   - Ensure >70% capability match for all assignments
   - Create dynamic specialists if needed
   - Require domain expertise for complex tasks
10. Auto-create review tasks for implementation work:
    - For every implementation task (TASK-030, TASK-040, etc.)
    - Create corresponding review task by domain expert
    - AI implementation ‚Üí @AI-Engineer review
    - Infrastructure ‚Üí @System-Engineer review
    - Security changes ‚Üí @Security-Engineer review
11. Create detailed task files in item directory:
    ```markdown
    # TASK-030: Implement [Feature Name]
    
    **Parent**: [STORY-ID or BUG-ID]
    **Type**: implementation
    **Assigned To**: @[SpecialistRole]
    **Priority**: [blocking|critical_path|parallel|optional]
    **Estimated Hours**: [X]
    **Dependencies**: [TASK-010, TASK-020]
    **Review Task**: TASK-031
    
    ## Description
    [Detailed implementation requirements based on design]
    
    ## Technical Approach
    [Specific technical approach from architect planning]
    
    ## Acceptance Criteria
    - [ ] [Specific criterion 1]
    - [ ] [Specific criterion 2]

    ## Status
    - Status: PLANNED
    - Created: [current_date]
    - Created By: @[SpecialistArchitect]
    - Estimated: [X] hours
    ```
12. Set task dependencies and priorities:
    - Process tasks ‚Üí blocking priority
    - Core implementation ‚Üí critical_path priority
    - Reviews and wrap-up ‚Üí parallel priority
    - Documentation ‚Üí optional priority
13. Update parent item:
    - Add all task IDs to tasks array
    - Calculate total estimated hours
    - Transition phase from PLANNING to REFINING
    - Set task_planning_complete to true
14. Create task dependency graph:
    - Visual representation of task flow
    - Identify critical path
    - Mark parallel execution opportunities
15. Generate task summary:
    "‚úÖ Task planning completed for [ITEM-ID]"
    "üìã Created [X] tasks ([Y] implementation, [Z] review, [A] process)"
    "‚è±Ô∏è Total estimated: [X] hours"
    "üîó Critical path: [X] tasks"
    "üéØ Phase: REFINING (ready for execution)"
16. Store task planning insights in memory
17. Update specialist architect scores (+2.0P for planning, +1.0Q for quality)
