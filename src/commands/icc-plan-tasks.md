# Plan Tasks

Create individual task files using $ARGUMENTS as story/bug ID.

## Workflow Integration

This command creates tasks that follow the **Inner Workflow Template** phases from `workflow-templates/inner-workflow.yaml`:

1. **knowledge_retrieval** - Process tasks (001-009) for loading context
2. **task_planning** - Handled during task creation by this command
3. **task_execution** - Core implementation tasks (010-994)
4. **task_validation** - Built into each task's acceptance criteria
5. **peer_review** - Auto-generated review tasks for implementations
6. **git_operations** - Wrap-up task (997) for commits/pushes
7. **task_completion** - Wrap-up task (999) for verification
8. **knowledge_generation** - Wrap-up task (998) for learning capture

## Behavioral Sequence
1. Verify current role is Specialist-Architect:
   - Must be @AI-Architect, @System-Architect, @Security-Architect, etc.
   - If not specialist architect, respond "Error: Task planning requires Specialist-Architect role. Current: [current_role]"
2. Parse $ARGUMENTS to extract item ID (STORY-XXX or BUG-XXX format)
3. If item ID missing, respond "Error: Item ID required (format: STORY-XXX or BUG-XXX)"
4. Validate item exists and is ready for task planning:
   - Locate item file based on type
   - If not found, respond "Error: Item [ITEM-ID] not found"
   - Load item YAML and verify phase is PLANNING
   - Verify planning order exists (from icc-plan-order)
5. If item not ready:
   - Respond "Error: Item must be in PLANNING phase with planning order. Current: [phase]"
6. Load planning context:
   - Read planning order document
   - Review dependencies and constraints
   - Load similar patterns from memory
   - Apply specialist architect domain expertise
7. Generate comprehensive task breakdown using standardized numbering:
   
   **Process Tasks (001-009) - Inner Workflow Phase: knowledge_retrieval**
   - TASK-001: Knowledge Loading (search memory, load context)
   - TASK-002: Dependency Resolution (resolve external dependencies)
   - TASK-003: Environment Setup (prepare tools, access, etc.)
   
   **Core Work Tasks (010-994) - Inner Workflow Phase: task_execution**
   - TASK-010: Analysis/Investigation (understand requirements)
   - TASK-020: Design/Architecture (create technical design)
   - TASK-030: Implementation (core development work)
   - TASK-040: Integration (connect with existing systems)
   - TASK-050: Configuration (setup and configuration)
   - TASK-060: Additional implementation tasks as needed
   
   **Quality Assurance (Auto-generated) - Inner Workflow Phase: peer_review**
   - TASK-[X+1]: Peer Review (for each implementation task)
   - Domain expert review by appropriate specialist
   
   **Wrap-up Tasks (995-999) - Inner Workflow Phases: git_operations, knowledge_generation, task_completion**
   - TASK-995: Documentation (update docs, comments)
   - TASK-996: Testing Validation (verify all tests pass)
   - TASK-997: Git Operations (commit, push, PR) - Phase: git_operations
   - TASK-998: Knowledge Creation (capture learnings) - Phase: knowledge_generation
   - TASK-999: Completion Verification (validate done) - Phase: task_completion

8. Apply domain-specific task patterns:
   
   **AI/ML Work:**
   - Data preparation and validation tasks
   - Model training and optimization tasks
   - Behavioral pattern implementation
   - AI system integration tasks
   
   **Infrastructure Work:**
   - Environment provisioning tasks

   - Monitoring and logging configuration
   - Security and compliance validation
   
   **Frontend Work:**
   - Component design and implementation
   - User experience validation
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Accessibility compliance

9. Validate specialist assignments for each task:
   - Execute `icc-validate-work-type` for each task
   - Ensure >70% capability match for all assignments
   - Create dynamic specialists if needed
   - Require domain expertise for complex tasks
10. Auto-create review tasks for implementation work:
    - For every implementation task (TASK-030, TASK-040, etc.)
    - Create corresponding review task by domain expert
    - AI implementation ‚Üí @AI-Engineer review
    - Infrastructure ‚Üí @System-Engineer review
    - Security changes ‚Üí @Security-Engineer review
11. Create detailed task files in item directory:
    ```markdown
    # TASK-030: Implement [Feature Name]
    
    **Parent**: [STORY-ID or BUG-ID]
    **Type**: implementation
    **Assigned To**: @[SpecialistRole]

- 031: Peer Review (for 030) - Phase: peer_review
- 040: Integration - Connect with existing systems
- 041: Peer Review (for 040) - Phase: peer_review
- 050-094: Additional work tasks - Further implementation
- 100-994: Extended work for complex items

**995-999: Wrap-up Tasks (Multiple phases)**

## Workflow Phase Progression

Tasks created by this command follow the **Inner Workflow** phases in sequence:

1. **knowledge_retrieval** (001-009): Tasks start here to gather context and patterns
2. **task_planning**: Handled by this command during task creation
3. **task_execution** (010-994): Main work performed by specialists
4. **task_validation**: Built into acceptance criteria and definition of done
5. **peer_review** (031, 041, etc.): Auto-generated for each implementation task
6. **git_operations** (997): Commit and push completed work
7. **task_completion** (999): Final verification and status update
8. **knowledge_generation** (998): Capture and store learnings

### Phase Prerequisites
- Cannot execute tasks before knowledge retrieval
- Cannot commit before validation
- Cannot complete before knowledge generation
- Peer review required for implementation tasks

### Phase Enforcement
The workflow phase enforcer (`behaviors/workflow-phase-enforcer.md`) ensures:
- Tasks execute in correct phase order
- Prerequisites are met before phase transitions
- Blocked actions are explained with corrective guidance
- Progress tracking follows phase completion
