# Think Sequential

Perform deep sequential thinking analysis on $ARGUMENTS using multi-step problem decomposition.

## Behavioral Sequence
1. Initialize sequential thinking mode:
   - Activate ultra-experienced mindset (10+ years expertise)
   - Prepare for iterative thought progression
   - Set initial thought number and total estimate
2. Parse $ARGUMENTS to extract:
   - Problem statement or complex scenario
   - Context and constraints
   - Desired outcome or solution target
3. Execute sequential thinking process:
   - Start with thought 1, estimate total thoughts needed
   - Break down problem into logical steps
   - Question assumptions at each step
   - Revise thinking as understanding deepens
   - Allow thought count to expand if needed
4. Apply ultra-thinking depth:
   - Consider edge cases and alternative approaches
   - Challenge initial solutions
   - Think beyond immediate requirements
   - Explore unintended consequences
5. Generate solution hypothesis:
   - Synthesize thoughts into coherent approach
   - Identify key decision points
   - Note areas of uncertainty
6. Verify hypothesis against thoughts:
   - Check consistency with earlier analysis
   - Validate against constraints
   - Assess feasibility and risks
7. Repeat process if needed:
   - If hypothesis doesn't satisfy: iterate
   - If gaps found: add more thoughts
   - Continue until satisfactory solution
8. Output final analysis:
   - Present thought progression
   - Highlight key insights
   - Provide actionable recommendations
   - Document uncertainties and assumptions

## Arguments
**Format:** Complex problem description or scenario requiring deep analysis
**Examples:**
- "How to implement user authentication with social login and 2FA requirements"
- "Design approach for migrating monolithic system to microservices"
- "Strategy for handling high-volume real-time data processing"

## Core Actions
- Break complex problems into manageable thought steps
- Apply systematic questioning to challenge assumptions
- Revise and refine thinking iteratively
- Generate and verify solution hypotheses
- Document complete thought progression

## Integration Points
- Used before major task decomposition
- Required for architectural decisions
- Triggered by complex problem detection
- Feeds into task creation and role assignment

## Output Format
Present complete sequential thinking chain showing:
- Numbered thought progression
- Revision points where thinking changed
- Final solution hypothesis
- Verification against original requirements
- Key insights and recommendations

## Quality Standards
- Minimum 5 thoughts for complex problems
- Show actual revision of thinking where it occurs
- Question at least 2 initial assumptions
- Provide evidence-based reasoning
- Include uncertainty acknowledgment where appropriate

## Error Handling
- Insufficient detail: "Error: Problem requires more specific context for analysis"
- Too simple: "Note: Problem may not require sequential thinking - simple analysis sufficient"
- Stuck in analysis: "Moving to hypothesis generation after [N] thoughts to maintain progress"
- Invalid input: "Error: Sequential thinking requires a clear problem statement"
