# icc:create-story

Create a new story within an epic with basic structure. This is a Stage 1 (DEFINING) command that creates the story without any tasks. PM-only command.

## Usage
```
icc-create-story "Story title" --epic EPIC-XXX --project-scope "Story-specific scope" [--priority P2] [--type feature]
```

## Parameters
- `title`: Story title/description (required)
- `--epic`: Parent epic ID (required)
- `--project-scope`: Story-specific scope within epic context (required)
- `--priority`: P0, P1, P2, P3 (default: P2)
- `--type`: feature, enhancement, refactor, process_enhancement (default: feature)

## Implementation
Creates story structure following Stage 1 (DEFINING) workflow:

1. **Role Validation**: Verify current role is @PM (required)
2. **Epic Validation**: Verify parent epic exists
3. **ID Generation**: Generate next available STORY-XXX ID
4. **Directory Creation**: Create story directory under epic
5. **YAML Creation**: Create story.yaml with metadata
6. **Epic Update**: Add story reference to parent epic
7. **No Task Creation**: Stage 1 - defining only, no tasks

## Expected Output
```
üìã Story Creation (Stage 1: DEFINING)

üîê Role Check: @PM ‚úÖ
üîç Parent Epic: EPIC-002 ‚úÖ
üÜî Generated ID: STORY-023
üìÅ Creating: epics/EPIC-002-workflow-enhancement/stories/STORY-023-api-integration/

‚úÖ Story created successfully:
  - ID: STORY-023
  - Title: API Integration Framework
  - Epic: EPIC-002
  - Status: PLANNED
  - Phase: DEFINING
  - Priority: P1
  - Project Scope: ‚úÖ Included

üìù Updated parent epic with story reference

‚è≠Ô∏è  Next Step: Use /icc-plan-order to plan execution with Architect
```

## YAML Structure
```yaml
story:
  id: "STORY-XXX"
  title: "Story title"
  type: "feature"
  epic: "EPIC-XXX"
  created: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
  created_by: "@PM"
  assigned_to: ""  # Will be assigned during planning
  priority: "P2"
  severity: "MEDIUM"  # Adjusted based on priority
  status: "PLANNED"
  phase: "DEFINING"
  
problem_statement: |
  [Generated from title and context]
  
user_story: |
  As a [user type], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
  
business_value: |
  [Generated from project scope]
  
project_scope: |
  [From --project-scope parameter]
  
acceptance_criteria: []  # Will be defined during planning

definition_of_done:
  - To be defined during planning phase
  
# Embedded config inherits from epic
embedded_config:
  autonomy_level: "L2"
  pm_always_active: true
  
workflow:
  current_phase: "DEFINING"
  approach: "to_be_determined"
  
tasks: []  # Empty - will be added in Stage 3 (REFINING)
```

## Validation
- **PM Role Required**: Only @PM can create stories
- **Epic Must Exist**: Parent epic must be valid
- **Project Scope Mandatory**: Must include story-specific scope
- **No Tasks Created**: Stage 1 creates structure only
- **ID Uniqueness**: Checks existing stories to avoid duplicates

## Epic Update
Automatically adds story reference to parent epic:
```yaml
stories:
  - id: "STORY-XXX"
    title: "Story title"
    description: "Brief description"
    status: "PLANNED"
    priority: "P2"
```

## Integration
- Updates ID tracking system (when implemented)
- Creates story under correct epic directory
- Updates parent epic with story reference
- Sets initial status: PLANNED and phase: DEFINING
- Ready for Stage 2: PLANNING with /icc-plan-order
