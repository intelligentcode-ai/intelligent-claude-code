# Queue Add

Add task to priority queue for L3 autonomous execution using $ARGUMENTS.

## Behavior
Add tasks to the priority-based execution queue with proper priority calculation,
dependency tracking, and conflict detection. Supports L3 continuous execution
with intelligent task scheduling and parallel execution planning.

## Arguments
**Format:** "Task: TASK-ID | Priority: P0|P1|P2|P3 | Type: blocking|critical_path|parallel|optional | Dependencies: TASK-001,TASK-002"
**Example:** "Task: TASK-015 | Priority: P1 | Type: critical_path | Dependencies: TASK-010,TASK-012"

## Core Actions
- Parse task details from $ARGUMENTS
- Validate task exists and is ready for execution
- Calculate numeric priority using priority formula
- Check task dependencies and blockers
- Detect potential conflicts with queued tasks
- Add task to priority queue with metadata
- Update task status to queued
- Trigger queue processing if in L3 mode
- Log queue addition for monitoring

## Priority Calculation

### Priority Formula
```
Numeric Priority = Epic Priority × 1000 + Task Type × 100 + Age in Minutes
```

### Epic Priority Values
- **P0 (Critical)**: 0 (highest priority)
- **P1 (High)**: 1000
- **P2 (Medium)**: 2000
- **P3 (Low)**: 3000 (lowest priority)

### Task Type Values
- **blocking**: 0 (must complete before others)
- **critical_path**: 100 (affects delivery timeline)
- **parallel**: 200 (can run simultaneously)
- **optional**: 300 (can be skipped if needed)

### Special Priority Rules
- **Security tasks**: Automatic escalation to P0
- **Customer issues**: Priority escalation by 1 level
- **System failures**: Immediate P0 escalation
- **Dependencies**: Inherit blocker priority

## Task Readiness Validation

### Execution Requirements
- **Dependencies Met**: All dependent tasks completed
- **No Active Blockers**: No unresolved blocking issues
- **Resources Available**: Required tools and access available
- **Role Assigned**: Valid specialist role assignment
- **Capability Validated**: Role assignment >70% capability match

### Dependency Checks
- Load task dependencies from task file
- Verify all dependent tasks have status COMPLETED
- Check for circular dependencies
- Validate dependency relationships are valid

### Resource Availability
- Check required tools are accessible
- Verify no resource conflicts with executing tasks
- Ensure specialist capacity available
- Validate environment readiness

## Conflict Detection

### File Conflicts
- Compare file paths being modified
- Detect overlapping file changes
- Prevent simultaneous modifications
- Queue conflicting tasks sequentially

### API Conflicts
- Identify same endpoint modifications
- Detect breaking API changes
- Prevent concurrent API development
- Serialize API-related tasks

### Schema Conflicts
- Database schema changes
- Data model modifications
- Migration dependencies
- Serialize database tasks

## Queue Management

### Queue Structure
```yaml
task_queue:
  TASK-015:
    numeric_priority: 1125  # P1 + critical_path + 25 minutes
    priority: P1
    type: critical_path
    dependencies: [TASK-010, TASK-012]
    conflicts: []
    added_timestamp: 2025-01-15T10:30:00Z
    estimated_duration: 120  # minutes
    assigned_role: @AI-Engineer
```

### Priority Ordering
- Tasks sorted by numeric_priority (ascending)
- Lower numbers execute first (P0 = 0, highest)
- Age prevents task starvation
- Emergency tasks can jump to front

## L3 Integration

### Automatic Processing
- Tasks added automatically trigger queue processing
- Parallel task selection for non-conflicting work
- Continuous execution without manual intervention
- Smart scheduling based on capacity and conflicts

### Parallel Execution Planning
- Select up to 5 non-conflicting tasks
- Consider specialist availability
- Optimize for maximum throughput
- Maintain quality standards

## Task Status Updates
- **PLANNED** → **QUEUED** when added to queue
- **QUEUED** → **EXECUTING** when picked up
- **EXECUTING** → **COMPLETED** when finished
- **BLOCKED** if dependencies fail

## Queue Monitoring
- Real-time queue status
- Priority distribution metrics
- Average wait times
- Throughput measurements
- Bottleneck identification

## Error Handling
- **Task Not Found**: Validate task exists
- **Invalid Priority**: Check priority format
- **Circular Dependencies**: Detect and report cycles
- **Resource Conflicts**: Queue for later execution
- **Capacity Exceeded**: Queue with delayed execution

## Integration
- Used by work discovery engine for found tasks
- Triggered by task completion for dependent tasks
- Integrates with L3 continuous engine
- Supports manual task queuing
- Connected to progress monitoring systems

## Quality Standards
- Accurate priority calculation
- Reliable dependency tracking
- Efficient conflict detection
- Fast queue operations
- Comprehensive task validation
