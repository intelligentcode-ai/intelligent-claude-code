# Command Chain System - MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT

**CORE:** Command chain enforcement • Memory-first culture • Quality gates • Agentic coordination

## CRITICAL COMMAND CHAIN DIRECTIVES

**DIRECTIVE 1:** EVERY message → Use command chains FIRST (/memory-first → /think-sequential → execute)
**DIRECTIVE 2:** EVERY action → Memory search BEFORE + store AFTER via /memory-first
**DIRECTIVE 3:** EVERY task → Use /parallel-delegate for multi-role work
**DIRECTIVE 4:** EVERY completion → Pass /quality-gates before finalization
**DIRECTIVE 5:** Command chain bypassing triggers auto-correction workflows

## COMMAND CHAIN IMPORTS

**CORE COMMANDS:**
@~/.claude/commands/core/memory-first.md
@~/.claude/commands/core/think-sequential.md
@~/.claude/commands/core/parallel-delegate.md

**SYSTEM COMMANDS:**
@~/.claude/commands/core/init.md
@~/.claude/commands/core/reset.md
@~/.claude/commands/core/refresh.md

**SHARED COMMANDS:**
@~/.claude/commands/shared/quality-gates.md

**ROLE-SPECIFIC COMMANDS:**
@~/.claude/commands/pm/strategic-analysis.md

## COMMAND CHAIN PATTERNS

**SIMPLE PATTERN:**
```
/memory-first → execute → /quality-gates
```

**COMPLEX PATTERN:**
```
/memory-first → /think-sequential → execute → /quality-gates
```

**MULTI-ROLE PATTERN:**
```
/memory-first → /think-sequential → /parallel-delegate → integrate → /quality-gates
```

**STRATEGIC PATTERN:**
```
/memory-first → /think-sequential → /parallel-delegate → analyze → decide → /quality-gates
```

**SYSTEM MANAGEMENT PATTERNS:**
```
/init → system validation → team activation → readiness report
/reset → state clearing → configuration reload → capability restoration
/refresh → module reload → capability sync → enhancement report
```

## ENFORCEMENT RULES

- **ALL roles must use appropriate command chains** for their tasks
- **Command chain bypassing triggers auto-correction** workflows  
- **Quality standards non-negotiable** across all chains
- **Memory integration mandatory** for all command execution
- **P:-1.0 penalty** for skipping mandatory chains
- **Q:-2.0 penalty** for bypassing quality gates

## COMMAND CHAIN EXECUTION

**ACTIVATION:** Load chain → Validate prerequisites → Execute → Validate results → Store outcomes
**MONITORING:** Real-time chain compliance tracking with penalty enforcement
**CORRECTION:** Auto-correction workflows trigger on chain bypass or failure
**LEARNING:** Chain effectiveness tracked in scores.md and learning-callouts.md

## SYSTEM COMMAND USAGE

**INITIALIZATION:**
- `/init` - Initialize virtual team system, verify all components operational
- Use when: Starting new session, first-time setup, system validation needed

**RECOVERY OPERATIONS:**
- `/reset` - Reset virtual team to clean state, clear accumulated issues
- Use when: System stuck, accumulated penalties, fresh start needed

**CAPABILITY MANAGEMENT:**
- `/refresh` - Refresh team capabilities, sync tools and configurations
- Use when: New tools available, configuration updates, performance optimization

## SYSTEM COMMAND PATTERNS

**STARTUP SEQUENCE:**
```
/init → configuration validation → team activation → /memory-first → operations
```

**RECOVERY SEQUENCE:**
```
/reset → state clearing → /init → system validation → operations
```

**ENHANCEMENT SEQUENCE:**
```
/refresh → capability sync → enhanced operations → /quality-gates
```
