# Test Enforcement

Test self-correcting validation enforcement with real scenarios

## Usage

## Behavior
Tests self-correcting validation enforcement with real scenarios including wrong role assignments, missing specialists, and capability mismatches. Validates automatic corrections and provides detailed reporting on enforcement effectiveness.

## Expected Output
```
ðŸ§ª Testing Self-Correcting Validation Enforcement
==================================================

ðŸ“‹ Test 1: Wrong Role Assignment
Before: @Developer
After: @AI-Engineer
âœ… Auto-corrected to specialist!

ðŸ“‹ Test 2: Git Privacy Violation
Before: Fix validation bug with Claude's assistance ðŸ¤–
After: Fix validation bug
âœ… AI mentions auto-stripped!

ðŸ“‹ Test 3: Missing Architect Consultation
Before: No architect consultation
After: @AI-Architect auto-activated and consulted
âœ… Architect consultation enforced!

ðŸ“‹ Test 4: L3 Bypass Attempt
Attempt: Skip validation citing L3 autonomy
Enforcement: Validation STILL executed
âœ… L3 accelerates validation, doesn't bypass!

==================================================
âœ¨ All enforcement tests PASSED!
Self-correcting validation is ACTIVE and WORKING!
```
