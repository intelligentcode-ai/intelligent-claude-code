# Test Enforcement

Test self-correcting validation enforcement using $ARGUMENTS for test scope.

## Behavioral Sequence
1. Parse $ARGUMENTS for test options:
   - --scope: all, roles, git, workflow (default: all)
   - --severity: strict, normal, advisory (default: normal)
   - --output: detailed, summary, json (default: detailed)
   - --fix: auto, manual, report-only (default: auto)
2. Display test initiation:
   "🧪 Testing validation enforcement system"
   "Scope: [all|roles|git|workflow]"
   "Severity: [strict|normal|advisory]"
   "Mode: [auto-fix|manual|report-only]"
3. Initialize test environment:
   - Save current system state for restoration
   - Create test workspace: `/tmp/icc-enforcement-test/`
   - Set up mock scenarios and test data
   - Enable detailed logging for test analysis
4. Execute role assignment enforcement tests:
   
   **Test 1: Wrong Role Assignment**
   ```
   Scenario: @Developer assigned to AI-agentic work
   Expected: Auto-correction to @AI-Engineer
   
   Before: @Developer assigned to "Implement behavioral patterns"
   Enforcement: /icc-detect-work-type → /icc-validate-assignments
   After: @AI-Engineer assigned (capability match: 95%)
   Result: ✅ PASSED - Auto-corrected role assignment
   ```
   
   **Test 2: Missing Architect Consultation**
   ```
   Scenario: AI work without @AI-Architect approval
   Expected: Require triage and approval
   
   Before: Task created without architect review
   Enforcement: /icc-require-triage → /icc-require-approval
   After: @PM + @AI-Architect approval required
   Result: ✅ PASSED - Enforced architect consultation
   ```
   
   **Test 3: Capability Mismatch**
   ```
   Scenario: Role with <70% capability match
   Expected: Create dynamic specialist
   
   Before: @Web-Designer assigned to database migration
   Enforcement: /icc-validate-assignments (32% match)
   After: @Database-Engineer created and assigned
   Result: ✅ PASSED - Created appropriate specialist
   ```

5. Execute git privacy enforcement tests:
   
   **Test 4: AI Mentions in Commit**
   ```
   Scenario: Commit message contains AI references
   Expected: Auto-strip AI mentions
   
   Before: "Implement auth with Claude's assistance 🤖"
   Enforcement: git_privacy enforcement active
   After: "Implement auth"
   Result: ✅ PASSED - Cleaned commit message
   ```
   
   **Test 5: Branch Protection Violation**
   ```
   Scenario: Direct push to main branch
   Expected: Block and suggest PR workflow
   
   Before: git push origin main
   Enforcement: Branch protection rules
   After: Error + suggestion to create PR
   Result: ✅ PASSED - Enforced branch protection
   ```

6. Execute workflow enforcement tests:
   
   **Test 6: Phase Transition Violation**
   ```
   Scenario: Task creation without proper phase
   Expected: Auto-correct phase and dependencies
   
   Before: Task created in DEFINING phase story
   Enforcement: Workflow compliance monitor
   After: Story transitioned to EXECUTE phase
   Result: ✅ PASSED - Fixed workflow sequence
   ```
   
   **Test 7: Missing Dependency Resolution**
   ```
   Scenario: Task execution with unresolved dependencies
   Expected: Block execution until dependencies met
   
   Before: TASK-030 starts with TASK-020 incomplete
   Enforcement: Dependency validation
   After: Execution blocked until TASK-020 complete
   Result: ✅ PASSED - Enforced dependency order
   ```

7. Execute L3 autonomy enforcement tests:
   
   **Test 8: L3 Bypass Attempt**
   ```
   Scenario: Manual intervention in L3 mode
   Expected: Continue autonomous execution
   
   Before: User confirmation prompt in L3
   Enforcement: L3 continuous engine
   After: Auto-continue without user input
   Result: ✅ PASSED - Maintained autonomy
   ```
   
   **Test 9: Critical Stop Condition**
   ```
   Scenario: Security violation in L3 mode
   Expected: Stop for critical condition
   
   Before: Credential exposure detected
   Enforcement: L3 stop conditions
   After: Execution halted for manual review
   Result: ✅ PASSED - Stopped for security
   ```

8. Execute learning enforcement tests:
   
   **Test 10: Repeated Error Pattern**
   ```
   Scenario: Same error made twice
   Expected: Double penalty applied
   
   Before: Second "missing-validation" error
   Enforcement: Learning system tracking
   After: -2.0P penalty (double) applied
   Result: ✅ PASSED - Enforced learning penalty
   ```

9. Compile test results:
   ```
   🧪 Enforcement Test Results
   
   Role Assignment Tests: [X]/[Y] passed
   Git Privacy Tests: [X]/[Y] passed
   Workflow Tests: [X]/[Y] passed
   L3 Autonomy Tests: [X]/[Y] passed
   Learning Tests: [X]/[Y] passed
   
   Overall: [X]/[Y] tests passed ([Z%] success rate)
   ```
10. Analyze enforcement effectiveness:
    - Calculate auto-correction success rate
    - Identify any enforcement gaps
    - Measure performance impact of enforcement
    - Generate improvement recommendations
11. Restore original system state:
    - Restore from saved state before tests
    - Clean up test workspace
    - Reset any test-modified settings
    - Verify system integrity post-test
12. Display final enforcement status:
    "✅ Enforcement testing completed"
    "📈 Success Rate: [X%] ([Y]/[Z] tests passed)"
    "⚡ Auto-Correction: [A] scenarios handled"
    "🔒 Security: [B] critical stops triggered"
    "🏆 Effectiveness: [rating] (Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement)"

## Error Handling
- Test environment setup failed: "Error: Could not create test environment: [specific error]"
- Enforcement system unavailable: "Error: Validation enforcement not active"
- Test data creation failed: "Warning: Some test scenarios skipped due to setup issues"
- State restoration failed: "Error: Could not restore original state: [specific error]"
- Test execution timeout: "Warning: Test [test_name] timed out after [X] seconds"
