# icc:verify-behaviors

Verify that all behavioral patterns and system components are functioning correctly after restoration.

## Usage
```
icc-verify-behaviors
```

## Implementation
This command performs comprehensive behavioral validation:

1. **BEHAVIORAL MODULE CHECK**: Verify all ~/.claude/behaviors/ modules are loaded
2. **ROLE SYSTEM CHECK**: Test @-notation role switching functionality
3. **WORKFLOW ENGINE CHECK**: Validate lean-workflow-executor is active
4. **MEMORY INTEGRATION CHECK**: Test MCP memory system connectivity
5. **SCORING SYSTEM CHECK**: Verify badges.md scoring is operational
6. **COMMAND SYSTEM CHECK**: Test all icc- commands are available
7. **ID TRACKING CHECK**: Validate ID-TRACKER.md is functional
8. **L3 AUTONOMY CHECK**: Verify L3 continuous execution if configured

## Expected Output
```
