# /parallel-delegate Command Chain

**PURPOSE:** Intelligent parallel delegation for multi-role work with coordination enforcement

## COMMAND EXECUTION

**TRIGGER:** Multi-role tasks requiring coordination and parallel execution
**PENALTY:** P:-1.0 for bypassing when multi-role work identified  
**AUTHORITY:** PM-led coordination with role specialization optimization

## PARALLEL DELEGATION PROTOCOL

1. **Role Analysis** - Identify optimal roles for each task component
2. **Task Decomposition** - Break work into parallel-executable chunks
3. **Dependency Mapping** - Sequence dependencies and critical paths
4. **Resource Allocation** - Assign roles with load balancing
5. **Coordination Setup** - Establish communication and integration points

## DELEGATION CHAIN STEPS

**STEP 1: MULTI-ROLE ASSESSMENT**
```
Analyze: Task components requiring different expertise
Identify: Optimal roles for each component
Map: Skill requirements to available specialists
Validate: Role coverage and capability matching
```

**STEP 2: TASK DECOMPOSITION**
```
Break: Large tasks into role-specific components
Define: Clear deliverables and acceptance criteria
Sequence: Identify parallel vs sequential work
Optimize: Minimize cross-role dependencies
```

**STEP 3: DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS**
```
Map: Dependencies between task components
Identify: Critical path and bottleneck risks
Plan: Integration points and handoff procedures
Mitigate: Dependency conflicts and blockers
```

**STEP 4: ROLE ASSIGNMENT**
```
Select: Optimal roles based on expertise and availability
Balance: Workload distribution across team
Delegate: Clear task assignment with context
Monitor: Role performance and progress tracking
```

**STEP 5: COORDINATION FRAMEWORK**
```
Establish: Communication protocols between roles
Define: Integration checkpoints and reviews
Plan: Progress aggregation and reporting
Setup: Quality validation across all components
```

## PARALLEL EXECUTION PATTERNS

**INDEPENDENT PARALLEL:**
- Tasks with no cross-dependencies
- Roles work simultaneously on separate components
- Results aggregated at completion

**STAGED PARALLEL:**
- Tasks with sequential dependencies
- Multiple roles work on different stages
- Handoff coordination at stage boundaries

**COLLABORATIVE PARALLEL:**
- Tasks requiring ongoing coordination
- Roles work together with frequent integration
- Continuous communication and synchronization

## ROLE COORDINATION RULES

**PM RESPONSIBILITIES:**
- Overall coordination and progress tracking
- Integration of parallel work streams
- Quality validation across all components
- Resource allocation and conflict resolution

**ROLE RESPONSIBILITIES:**
- Execute assigned components with expertise
- Communicate progress and blockers
- Integrate with other roles as needed
- Deliver quality results meeting acceptance criteria

## ENFORCEMENT RULES

- **MULTI-ROLE DETECTION**: Auto-identify when multiple roles needed
- **PARALLEL OPTIMIZATION**: Maximize parallel execution opportunities
- **COORDINATION MANDATORY**: PM must coordinate multi-role work
- **QUALITY INTEGRATION**: All components must pass quality gates
- **PENALTY**: P:-1.0 for bypassing when multi-role work identified

## DELEGATION TRIGGERS

**MANDATORY USE:**
- Tasks requiring multiple specializations
- Large implementations with separable components
- Cross-functional requirements (dev + design + ops)
- Architecture spanning multiple domains

**OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:**
- Testing while development continues
- Documentation parallel to implementation
- Security review parallel to development
- Multiple similar tasks (batch processing)

## COMMAND CHAIN CONTINUATION

**SUCCESS:** → Parallel execution begins → Integration phase → /quality-gates
**INSUFFICIENT:** → Retry delegation with clearer decomposition
**BYPASS:** → P:-1.0 penalty, forced multi-role coordination
