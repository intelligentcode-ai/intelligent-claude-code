# /refresh Command Chain

**PURPOSE:** Refresh team capabilities and sync all systems without full reset

## COMMAND EXECUTION

**TRIGGER:** Capability updates, configuration changes, tool availability changes
**REQUIREMENT:** Live system refresh while maintaining operational state
**AUTHORITY:** System-level refresh for capability enhancement and synchronization

## REFRESH PROTOCOL

1. **Module Refresh** - Reload all behavioral modules without clearing state
2. **Configuration Update** - Sync configuration changes and new capabilities
3. **Tool Availability Sync** - Update tool integration and fallback chains
4. **Memory State Sync** - Refresh memory connections and optimize performance
5. **Team Status Assessment** - Report current capabilities and operational status

## REFRESH STEPS

**STEP 1: BEHAVIORAL MODULE REFRESH**
```
Reload: All behaviors/ modules with latest updates
Sync: New behavioral patterns and capabilities
Update: Enhanced enforcement and quality protocols
Refresh: Command chain patterns and optimizations
```

**STEP 2: CONFIGURATION SYNCHRONIZATION**
```
Check: Configuration file timestamps for changes
Reload: Modified configuration modules only
Merge: New capabilities with existing operational state
Validate: Configuration consistency and dependency resolution
```

**STEP 3: TOOL INTEGRATION UPDATE**
```
Detect: Tool availability changes and new capabilities
Update: Context7 library access and documentation coverage
Refresh: Brave Search integration and query optimization
Sync: MCP server connections and new tool additions
Validate: Fallback chains and degradation handling
```

**STEP 4: MEMORY SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION**
```
Refresh: MCP memory connections and performance
Optimize: Knowledge graph relationships and queries
Sync: File-based fallback systems if needed
Update: Memory aging algorithms and retention policies
```

**STEP 5: CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**
```
Inventory: Current role capabilities and specializations
Assess: Dynamic specialist generation capacity
Validate: Quality gate enforcement and auto-correction
Report: Team operational status and recent enhancements
```
