# /think-sequential Command Chain

**PURPOSE:** FORCED sequential thinking for ALL complex problems - NO EXCEPTIONS

## COMMAND EXECUTION

**YOU MUST USE THIS:** For EVERY task with analysis, planning, or multi-step solutions
**AUTOMATIC PENALTY:** Q:-1.0 IMMEDIATELY APPLIED when you skip sequential analysis
**MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT:** You MUST HALT and use this command for ANY non-trivial task

## SEQUENTIAL THINKING PROTOCOL

1. **Problem Analysis** - Break down complex problems systematically
2. **Solution Planning** - Plan approach with clear steps and dependencies
3. **Risk Assessment** - Identify potential issues and mitigation strategies
4. **Resource Planning** - Determine tools, roles, and requirements needed
5. **Execution Strategy** - Define clear path to completion with validation points

## THINKING CHAIN STEPS - MANDATORY EXECUTION

**STEP 1: YOU MUST DECOMPOSE EVERY PROBLEM**
```
HALT EXECUTION NOW AND:
- YOU MUST USE mcp__sequential-thinking tool when available
- YOU MUST MAINTAIN numbered thought chains WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS
- YOU MUST TRACK all revisions and branches AUTOMATICALLY
- YOU MUST NOT PROCEED without proper decomposition

WHEN TOOL UNAVAILABLE, YOU MUST:
- IMMEDIATELY CREATE structured markdown analysis
- FORCE YOURSELF to break ALL problems into components
- MANDATE identification of EVERY requirement
- BLOCK continuation until dependencies are mapped
- HALT if complexity assessment is incomplete
```

**STEP 2: SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE**
```
Design: High-level approach and methodology
Plan: Detailed steps with clear sequence
Validate: Approach against requirements
Optimize: Efficiency and quality considerations
```

**STEP 3: RISK ANALYSIS**
```
Identify: Potential failure points and blockers
Assess: Impact and likelihood of risks
Mitigate: Strategies to prevent or handle issues
Prepare: Contingency plans for critical paths
```

**STEP 4: RESOURCE ALLOCATION**
```
Tools: Required tools and capabilities needed
Roles: Team members and specialists required
Time: Effort estimates and timeline planning
Dependencies: External requirements and constraints
```

**STEP 5: EXECUTION PLANNING**
```
Sequence: Optimal order of operations
Validation: Quality checkpoints and gates
Monitoring: Progress tracking mechanisms
Integration: How components fit together
```

## FORCED USAGE - NO EXCEPTIONS

**YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY USE THIS COMMAND FOR:**
- EVERY multi-step technical implementation - HALT AND FORCE
- ALL architecture decisions - NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED
- ANY cross-role coordination - MANDATORY SEQUENTIAL ANALYSIS
- EVERY problem with multiple solutions - BLOCK UNTIL ANALYZED
- ALL planning phases - FORCE COMPLETE ANALYSIS

**VIOLATION DETECTION - AUTOMATIC HALT:**
- Attempting simple task approach on complex problems → IMMEDIATE HALT
- Skipping sequential thinking → FORCE RESTART WITH PENALTY
- Proceeding without analysis → BLOCK AND PENALIZE

## QUALITY STANDARDS

**THOROUGHNESS:** Complete analysis covering all aspects
**CLARITY:** Clear reasoning and decision rationale
**FEASIBILITY:** Realistic and achievable plans
**EFFICIENCY:** Optimized approach considering constraints
**VALIDATION:** Plans tested against requirements

## MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT - IMMEDIATE AND AUTOMATIC

- **FORCED DETECTION**: YOU MUST HALT when complexity detected - NO OVERRIDE
- **BLOCKING GATES**: YOU CANNOT PROCEED without passing ALL quality checks
- **MANDATORY CAPTURE**: YOU MUST DOCUMENT every thought - NO EXCEPTIONS
- **AUTOMATIC PENALTY**: Q:-1.0 INSTANTLY APPLIED for ANY skip attempt
- **FORCED CORRECTION**: IMMEDIATE RESTART required on inadequate analysis

## HALT AND FORCE CONTINUATION PROTOCOL

**COMPLETION ONLY:** → YOU MAY ONLY proceed after FULL sequential analysis
**INSUFFICIENT ATTEMPT:** → IMMEDIATE HALT - FORCED COMPLETE RESTART
**BYPASS ATTEMPT:** → INSTANT Q:-1.0 PENALTY + MANDATORY FULL RESTART + BLOCKED UNTIL COMPLETE
