# /reset Command Chain

**PURPOSE:** Reset virtual team system to clean state and clear any operational issues

## COMMAND EXECUTION

**TRIGGER:** System recovery, stuck states, accumulated issues, fresh start needed
**REQUIREMENT:** Complete system reset with full re-initialization
**AUTHORITY:** System-level reset for all team operations and state

## RESET PROTOCOL

1. **State Clearing** - Clear all accumulated states and temporary data
2. **Configuration Reload** - Fresh reload of all configuration modules
3. **Memory Context Reset** - Reset memory context while preserving knowledge
4. **Penalty Clearing** - Reset all accumulated penalties and scoring issues
5. **Behavioral Pattern Restart** - Restart all behavioral enforcement systems

## RESET STEPS

**STEP 1: SYSTEM STATE CLEARING**
```
Clear: All temporary states and cached data
Reset: Any stuck process states or deadlocks
Flush: Accumulated context that may be causing issues
Clean: Any corrupted or incomplete operation states
```

**STEP 2: CONFIGURATION FRESH RELOAD**
```
Reload: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md with complete fresh import
Refresh: All virtual-team.md module dependencies
Clear: Any cached configuration interpretations
Validate: Fresh import resolution and dependency checking
```

**STEP 3: MEMORY CONTEXT MANAGEMENT**
```
Preserve: Core knowledge graph and entity relationships
Reset: Working memory and temporary context
Clear: Any stuck memory operations or locks
Refresh: Memory system connections and availability
```

**STEP 4: PENALTY AND SCORING RESET**
```
Clear: All accumulated P (process) and Q (quality) penalties
Reset: All role scores to baseline neutral state
Remove: Any temporary restrictions or limitations
Restore: Full operational capability for all roles
```

**STEP 5: BEHAVIORAL PATTERN RESTART**
```
Restart: All enforcement engines and quality gates
Reset: Command chain execution patterns
Clear: Any behavioral pattern conflicts or issues
Reactivate: Full behavioral intelligence framework
```

## RESET PATTERNS

**EMERGENCY RESET:**
- Immediate clearing of all problematic states
- Fast restart of core functionality
- Minimal validation for quick recovery
- Focus on restoring basic operations

**FULL SYSTEM RESET:**
- Complete clearing of all accumulated states
- Thorough reloading of all configurations
- Comprehensive validation of all systems
- Full re-initialization of all capabilities

**SELECTIVE RESET:**
- Targeted clearing of specific problem areas
- Partial reload of affected components
- Focused validation of reset areas
- Preservation of working components

## CLEARING OPERATIONS

**STATE MANAGEMENT:**
- Clear all role assignment states
- Reset task delegation histories
- Remove any process locks or blocks
- Clear temporary coordination states

**CONFIGURATION REFRESH:**
- Force reload all module imports
- Clear configuration interpretation cache
- Reset module dependency resolution
- Refresh behavioral pattern loading

**MEMORY OPERATIONS:**
- Reset working memory contexts
- Clear temporary relationship caches
- Refresh memory system connections
- Preserve core knowledge structures

**PENALTY MANAGEMENT:**
- Clear all P (process compliance) penalties
- Reset all Q (quality delivery) penalties
- Remove scoring restrictions and limitations
- Restore full role operational capabilities

## RESET VALIDATION

**SYSTEM CHECKS:**
- Verify all configurations reload correctly
- Confirm memory system operational
- Check tool integration functionality
- Validate command chain execution

**CAPABILITY VERIFICATION:**
- Test role activation and @-notation addressing
- Verify parallel delegation functionality
- Confirm quality gate enforcement operational
- Check behavioral pattern compliance

**STATE CONFIRMATION:**
- Confirm all problematic states cleared
- Verify no residual issues remain
- Check penalty systems reset properly
- Validate full operational capability restored

## RESET OUTCOMES

**SUCCESSFUL RESET:**
- All problematic states cleared
- Fresh configuration loaded and validated
- Memory system operational with preserved knowledge
- All penalties cleared and capabilities restored
- Behavioral patterns restarted and enforcing

**PARTIAL RESET:**
- Some issues resolved, others identified for attention
- Core functionality restored with noted limitations
- Specific areas requiring additional intervention
- Clear guidance for completing resolution

**RESET FAILURE:**
- Identification of persistent underlying issues
- Specific components that failed to reset
- Clear steps for manual intervention required
- Escalation path for complex problems

## POST-RESET VERIFICATION

**OPERATIONAL TESTING:**
- Test basic @-notation role addressing
- Verify command chain execution works
- Confirm quality gate enforcement active
- Check parallel delegation functionality

**SYSTEM HEALTH CHECK:**
- Memory system responding correctly
- Tool integration chains functional
- Configuration imports resolving properly
- Behavioral patterns enforcing correctly

**CAPABILITY RESTORATION:**
- All 14 core roles operational
- Dynamic specialist generation working
- Scoring system functional and fair
- Quality enforcement active without over-penalty

## COMMAND CHAIN CONTINUATION

**RESET SUCCESS:** → System ready for normal operations with clean state
**PARTIAL SUCCESS:** → System operational with documented limitations
**RESET FAILURE:** → Escalation to manual intervention with specific guidance

## AUTOMATIC POST-RESET ACTIONS

**IMMEDIATE VERIFICATION:**
- Run quick system health check
- Test core functionality patterns
- Verify no immediate issues present
- Confirm readiness for operation

**GRADUAL RESTORATION:**
- Allow natural rebuilding of working context
- Monitor for any recurring issues
- Track system stability over initial operations
- Document any patterns requiring attention
