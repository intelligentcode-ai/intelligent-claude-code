# /init Command Chain

**PURPOSE:** Initialize virtual team system and verify all components are operational

## COMMAND EXECUTION

**TRIGGER:** System startup, new project initialization, team activation
**REQUIREMENT:** Full system validation and component verification
**AUTHORITY:** System-level initialization for all team operations

## INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL

1. **Configuration Validation** - Verify core configuration exists and is valid
2. **Module Availability Check** - Confirm all behavioral modules are accessible
3. **Memory System Setup** - Initialize or verify memory subsystem
4. **Tool Integration Validation** - Check tool availability and fallback chains
5. **Team Readiness Assessment** - Validate all roles and capabilities

## INITIALIZATION STEPS

**STEP 1: CONFIGURATION VALIDATION**
```
Check: Verify ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md exists and is valid
Load: Import all required configuration modules
Validate: Confirm all @~/ imports resolve correctly
Verify: Check virtual-team.md and all dependencies
```

**STEP 2: MODULE AVAILABILITY ASSESSMENT**
```
Core Systems: Verify PM activation, scoring system, team configuration
Execution Engine: Check enforcement, L3 autonomy, quality gates
Role Framework: Validate 14 core roles and specialist capabilities
Integration Layer: Confirm memory, MCP, tool fallback systems
Operational Protocols: Check Git workflow, quality standards
Behavioral Modules: Verify all behaviors/ components loaded
```

**STEP 3: MEMORY SYSTEM INITIALIZATION**
```
MCP Detection: Check if mcp__memory tools are available
Memory Structure: Verify knowledge graph structure exists
Fallback Setup: Ensure file-based memory fallback ready
Context Loading: Load existing memory context if available
```

**STEP 4: TOOL INTEGRATION VALIDATION**
```
Context7: Check library documentation access
Brave Search: Verify web search capability
GitHub CLI: Validate gh command availability
MCP Servers: Check all configured MCP connections
Claude Tools: Confirm native tool availability
```

**STEP 5: TEAM READINESS VERIFICATION**
```
Role Definitions: Confirm all 14 core roles properly defined
Dynamic Specialists: Verify unlimited specialist generation capability
Command Chains: Check all command chain patterns functional
Quality Gates: Validate enforcement and auto-correction systems
Scoring System: Confirm P/Q tracking and penalty systems
```

## INITIALIZATION PATTERNS

**FRESH INSTALLATION:**
- First-time setup with complete configuration validation
- Memory system initialization from scratch
- Tool availability detection and fallback configuration
- Team readiness confirmation

**PROJECT ACTIVATION:**
- Existing configuration validation
- Project-specific context loading
- Memory system sync and context establishment
- Team capability assessment

**SYSTEM RECOVERY:**
- Configuration integrity check after issues
- Memory system recovery and validation
- Tool availability re-verification
- Team operational status confirmation

## VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

**CONFIGURATION CHECKS:**
- All import paths resolve to existing files
- No circular dependencies in module chain
- All required behavioral modules accessible
- Virtual team mode properly configured

**CAPABILITY VERIFICATION:**
- Memory system (MCP or file-based) operational
- Command chain patterns executable
- Quality gate enforcement functional
- Tool integration working with fallbacks

**TEAM READINESS:**
- All 14 core roles properly activated
- Dynamic specialist generation capability confirmed
- @-notation addressing functional
- Parallel delegation system operational

## INITIALIZATION OUTCOMES

**SUCCESS INDICATORS:**
- Configuration fully validated and loaded
- All modules accessible and functional
- Memory system operational (MCP or fallback)
- Tool chains configured with proper fallbacks
- Team fully activated and ready for operations

**FAILURE HANDLING:**
- Clear identification of missing components
- Specific guidance for resolution steps
- Graceful degradation where possible
- Retry mechanisms for transient issues

## SYSTEM READINESS REPORT

**CONFIGURATION STATUS:**
- Virtual team mode: [ACTIVE/INACTIVE]
- Module chain: [COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE - missing items]
- Import resolution: [SUCCESS/FAILED - broken imports]

**CAPABILITY STATUS:**
- Memory system: [MCP/FILE-BASED/UNAVAILABLE]
- Tool integration: [FULL/PARTIAL/LIMITED]
- Command chains: [OPERATIONAL/DEGRADED]

**TEAM STATUS:**
- Core roles: [14/14 ACTIVE or X/14 AVAILABLE]
- Dynamic specialists: [ENABLED/DISABLED]
- Quality enforcement: [ACTIVE/INACTIVE]
- Scoring system: [OPERATIONAL/OFFLINE]

## COMMAND CHAIN CONTINUATION

**FULL SUCCESS:** → System ready for virtual team operations
**PARTIAL SUCCESS:** → System operational with noted limitations
**INITIALIZATION FAILURE:** → Clear error reporting with resolution steps

## POST-INITIALIZATION ACTIONS

**AUTOMATIC SETUP:**
- Load initial memory context if available
- Establish baseline team configuration
- Activate behavioral pattern enforcement
- Begin continuous monitoring protocols

**MANUAL VALIDATION:**
- Test @-notation role addressing
- Verify command chain execution
- Confirm quality gate enforcement
- Validate parallel delegation capability
