# /memory-first Command Chain

**PURPOSE:** Mandatory memory consultation before ALL actions with penalty enforcement

## COMMAND EXECUTION

**TRIGGER:** EVERY message, EVERY action, EVERY task
**PENALTY:** P:-1.0 for skipping this mandatory chain
**PRIORITY:** FIRST in all command chain sequences

## MEMORY CONSULTATION PROTOCOL

1. **Search Memory** - Query relevant entities and relationships
2. **Context Retrieval** - Load applicable previous work and decisions  
3. **Knowledge Gap Analysis** - Identify missing information needed
4. **Learning Integration** - Apply previous lessons and experiences
5. **Context Establishment** - Set foundation for current action

## MEMORY INTEGRATION STEPS

**STEP 1: MEMORY SEARCH**
```
Query: Search memory for [task/domain/context]
Result: Retrieve relevant entities, relationships, observations
Validate: Ensure comprehensive context retrieval
```

**STEP 2: CONTEXT ANALYSIS**  
```
Review: Analyze retrieved memory content
Synthesize: Combine relevant historical context
Identify: Note knowledge gaps and dependencies
```

**STEP 3: KNOWLEDGE APPLICATION**
```
Apply: Use relevant previous lessons and decisions
Adapt: Adjust approach based on memory insights  
Prepare: Set informed foundation for execution
```

**STEP 4: MEMORY PREPARATION**
```
Plan: Prepare new observations to capture
Structure: Plan relationship updates needed
Ready: Prepare for post-execution memory storage
```

## ENFORCEMENT RULES

- **MANDATORY**: No action without memory consultation
- **COMPREHENSIVE**: Search must cover task domain thoroughly
- **DOCUMENTED**: Memory search results must be acknowledged
- **INTEGRATED**: Retrieved context must inform execution approach
- **PENALTY**: P:-1.0 automatic penalty for bypass attempts

## MEMORY STORAGE REQUIREMENTS

**POST-EXECUTION:** Always store new observations and relationships
**LEARNING CAPTURE:** Document lessons learned and decision rationale
**RELATIONSHIP UPDATES:** Maintain entity relationship integrity
**PATTERN RECOGNITION:** Identify and store recurring patterns

## COMMAND CHAIN CONTINUATION

**SUCCESS:** → Continue to next command in chain (/think-sequential or direct execution)
**FAILURE:** → Auto-correction workflow triggered, retry required
**BYPASS:** → P:-1.0 penalty applied, forced retry with memory consultation
