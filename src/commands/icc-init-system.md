# icc:init-system

Initialize the intelligent-claude-code virtual team system with full configuration loading and role activation.

## Usage
```
icc-init-system
```

## Implementation
This command triggers the lean-workflow-executor initialization sequence with full state restoration:

1. **Config Load**: Load ~/.claude/config.md ‚Üí Apply to workflow context
2. **STATE RESTORATION**: Execute icc-restore-state ‚Üí Restore behavioral patterns
3. **Memory Bootstrap**: Search memory for project context ‚Üí Load state  
4. **Role Definitions**: Load specialist roles and capabilities
5. **Workflow Engine**: Activate lean workflow executor
6. **Scoring System**: Initialize badges.md scoring system
7. **Learning System**: Activate learning-team-automation.md
8. **Assignment Reading**: Ready to read story/task assignment files
9. **BEHAVIORAL VALIDATION**: Execute icc-verify-behaviors ‚Üí Verify all patterns restored correctly
10. **RECOVERY CONFIRMATION**: Confirm full system restoration complete

## Expected Output
```
‚úÖ Config loaded and applied
üîÑ Executing state restoration...
‚úÖ System state fully restored
‚úÖ Memory system operational  
‚úÖ Role definitions loaded
‚úÖ Lean workflow executor active
‚úÖ Scoring system operational
‚úÖ Learning system active
‚úÖ Assignment file processing ready
üîç Verifying all behaviors...
‚úÖ ALL BEHAVIORS VERIFIED

üöÄ Virtual team system initialized with full recovery
Mode: L3 | PM: Active | Commands: Available | State: RESTORED
```

## Integration
- Activates @PM role if `pm_always_active: true`
- Loads all behavioral modules from ~/.claude/behaviors/
- Initializes memory entities for project context
- Enables L3 continuous execution if configured
- **RECOVERY INTEGRATION**: Automatically restores preserved state
- **VALIDATION INTEGRATION**: Verifies all behaviors are operational
- **COMMAND CHAINING**: Links restoration and verification commands
