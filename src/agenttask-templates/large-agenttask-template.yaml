# Git Privacy Execution Notes
execution_notes: |
  CRITICAL: MANDATORY git_privacy validation BEFORE ALL git operations:
  1. Load git_privacy setting from configuration (NEVER assume)
  2. When git_privacy=true, strip ALL AI mentions from:
     - Commit messages (remove "AI", "Claude", "agent", "Generated with Claude Code", etc.)
     - PR descriptions and titles
     - Release notes and changelogs
     - Any git-visible text including co-author attributions
  3. Use clean, professional language in all git operations
  4. Block git operations if privacy setting not validated

# MCP Placeholder Resolution Notes
# During AgentTask generation, resolve these placeholders:
# [MCP_MEMORY_ENABLED] → Check mcp_integrations.memory.enabled
# [MCP_MEMORY_PROVIDER] → Get mcp_integrations.memory.provider
# [MCP_ISSUE_ENABLED] → Check mcp_integrations.issue_tracking.enabled

# [MCP_DOCS_ENABLED] → Check mcp_integrations.documentation.enabled
# [MCP_DOCS_PROVIDER] → Get mcp_integrations.documentation.provider
# If not configured, set to false/"file-based"
