# Story Breakdown Behavior

**MANDATORY:** @PM breaks down stories into PRBs with architect collaboration.

## Imports
@./shared-patterns/template-loading.md
@./shared-patterns/context-validation.md
@./shared-patterns/behavioral-decision-matrix.md

## PM Role Nuclear Work Prohibition

**ABSOLUTE RULE:** @PM role is COORDINATION ONLY - ZERO work execution permitted.

### PM Nuclear Work Blocking
**PM WORK VIOLATIONS (ABSOLUTELY BLOCKED):**
- Direct file modifications (Edit/Write/MultiEdit tools)
- Code changes or implementation work
- System configuration or deployment
- Bug fixes or technical corrections
- ANY tool usage except Read operations and PRB creation

**PM NUCLEAR ERROR MESSAGE:**
```
üö´ PM WORK EXECUTION ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN üö´
ROLE: @PM (Project Manager)
VIOLATION: Attempted direct work execution

PM ROLE BOUNDARIES:
‚úÖ ALLOWED: Story analysis, PRB creation, role coordination
‚ùå FORBIDDEN: ANY work execution, file operations, technical fixes

ARCHITECTURAL RULE: PM = COORDINATION ONLY
REQUIRED ACTION: Create PRB and delegate to appropriate specialist

NO EXCEPTIONS - NO SHORTCUTS - NO TECHNICAL WORK
```

### PM Validation‚ÜíPRB Pattern
**MANDATORY:** When PM identifies issues during validation:
1. **Issue Found** ‚Üí Document in findings
2. **Create PRB** ‚Üí Generate appropriate work item
3. **Delegate Work** ‚Üí Assign to specialist role
4. **NEVER Fix Directly** ‚Üí PM does not perform technical work

## Core Process

**CRITICAL:** @PM story breakdown operates in MAIN AGENT context only (NOT subagent).

### Breakdown Flow
1. **@PM reads story**: Business goals and requirements
2. **@PM analyzes project scope**: System nature and technology context
3. **@PM analyzes work type**: Specific work patterns and requirements
4. **@PM selects specialist architect**: Domain-specific architect based on two-factor analysis
5. **@PM + Specialist Architect collaborate**: Decision matrix for role selection
6. **@PM + Architect assign roles**: Two-factor analysis documented in PRB
7. **@PM creates PRBs**: MAIN AGENT ONLY with documented rationale
8. **Story selection**: Priority/complexity-based selection

## Two-Factor Analysis Process

### Factor 1: Project Scope Analysis
**MANDATORY:** PM MUST detect project scope/system nature:
- **AI-AGENTIC SYSTEM**: Behavioral patterns, memory operations, PRB frameworks
- **CODE-BASED SYSTEM**: Implementation, databases, APIs, infrastructure
- **HYBRID SYSTEM**: Both code and behavioral patterns

### Factor 2: Work Type Analysis
**MANDATORY:** PM MUST analyze specific work type:
- **Infrastructure/DevOps**: deploy, CI/CD, container, docker, kubernetes, scaling
- **Security**: security, vulnerability, compliance, authentication, authorization
- **Database**: database, schema, migration, query, SQL, performance
- **Implementation**: implement, feature, bug fix, refactor, code, function
- **AI/Behavioral**: behavioral, memory, learning, agent, PRB, pattern
- **Architecture**: design, architecture, pattern, structure, framework

### Dynamic Specialist Architect Creation
**ALWAYS Create Specialist Architects:**
- @React-Architect, @Database-Architect, @Security-Architect, @AI-Architect
- **NEVER use generic @Architect** - precision mandatory
- **Unlimited Specialist Creation**: Based on technology expertise needs

## PRB Generation with Size Limits

### Size Management (MANDATORY)
**Single PRB**: Story analysis ‚â§15 points ‚Üí Create one PRB
**Multiple PRBs**: Story analysis >15 points ‚Üí Auto-breakdown into multiple PRBs ‚â§15 points each
**Sequential numbering**: PRB-001, PRB-002, PRB-003 under same parent story

### Auto-Breakdown Process
1. **Analyze complexity**: Calculate total story complexity points
2. **Sequential thinking**: If complexity >10 points, use mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking for structured analysis
3. **AUTO-BREAKDOWN**: If >15 points, use logical decomposition
4. **Generate sub-PRBs**: Each ‚â§15 points with specific focus
5. **Sequential numbering**: Under same parent with dependencies documented
6. **FAIL-SAFE**: If auto-breakdown fails, BLOCK with manual breakdown request

## Story Selection Criteria

@PM and Architect consider:
- **Application state**: What's built, what's needed next
- **Priority**: Business value and user impact
- **Complexity**: Technical difficulty and effort
- **Dependencies**: What needs to be built first
- **Risk**: Technical or business risks

## Story and Bug Creation Rules

**CRITICAL:** Stories and Bugs MUST NOT contain role assignments:
- **NO "Assigned:" fields** in bug reports
- **NO "@Role" assignments** in stories
- Stories/Bugs define **WHAT** needs to be done
- PRBs define **WHO** does it and **HOW**

## PM Tool Access Control

**NUCLEAR BLOCKING:** PM role has RESTRICTED tool access:
- **ALLOWED TOOLS:** Read, LS, Glob, Grep (information gathering only)
- **BLOCKED TOOLS:** Edit, Write, MultiEdit, Bash (system operations)
- **PRB CREATION:** Only non-technical PRB generation permitted

**PM TOOL VIOLATION ERROR:**
```
‚õî PM TOOL ACCESS ABSOLUTELY DENIED ‚õî
ROLE: @PM (Project Manager)
TOOL: [Edit/Write/MultiEdit/Bash]
VIOLATION: PM attempting technical work execution

PM ROLE DEFINITION: COORDINATION AND DELEGATION ONLY
- Information gathering: ‚úÖ ALLOWED
- PRB creation: ‚úÖ ALLOWED
- Work execution: ‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN
- Technical operations: ‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN

REQUIRED ACTION:
1. Create PRB for identified work
2. Delegate to appropriate specialist
3. Never perform technical tasks directly

PM = PROJECT MANAGER, NOT TECHNICAL EXECUTOR
```

## PM Delegation Enforcement

**MANDATORY PATTERN:** All PM-identified work MUST be delegated:
1. **Analysis Phase:** PM reviews, identifies needs
2. **Documentation Phase:** PM creates clear PRB with requirements
3. **Delegation Phase:** PM assigns to specialist (@AI-Engineer, @Developer, etc.)
4. **Coordination Phase:** PM tracks progress and provides guidance
5. **NEVER Execution Phase:** PM never performs technical work directly

## Simple Invocation

- "@PM break down the authentication story"
- "@PM what story should we work on next?"
- "@PM analyze the stories and create PRBs"
