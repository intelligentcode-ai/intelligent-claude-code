# Story Breakdown Behavior (Minimal)

**MANDATORY:** Large work is broken into AgentTasks before execution.

## When to Create a Story
- Estimated complexity > 15 points
- Multi‑component or multi‑team scope

## Breakdown Process
1. **PM** reviews scope and goals
2. **Architect** advises on technical boundaries
3. Split into AgentTasks with clear success criteria
4. Assign roles based on domain expertise
