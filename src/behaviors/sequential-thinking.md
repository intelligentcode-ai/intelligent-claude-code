# Sequential Thinking Behavior

**MANDATORY:** Structured analytical thinking for complex problems using step-by-step reasoning patterns.

## Purpose

**Sequential thinking** provides structured analytical frameworks for complex problem decomposition, multi-factor analysis, and systematic reasoning patterns that enhance decision-making quality and traceability.

## Sequential Thinking Triggers

**MANDATORY:** Apply sequential thinking patterns LIBERALLY for:
- **Any Multi-Step Reasoning:** ANY request involving multiple considerations or steps
- **Request Analysis:** Understanding user requests with project context
- **Simple Task Planning:** Even straightforward tasks benefit from structured thinking
- **Story Breakdown:** Multi-factor story analysis with >10 total points
- **Bug Investigation:** All bug analysis requiring root cause identification
- **AgentTask Planning:** Multi-step AgentTask creation and breakdown scenarios
- **Architecture Evaluation:** Design decisions with multiple factors or trade-offs
- **Risk Assessment:** Security, performance, or technical risk evaluation
- **Integration Analysis:** Cross-component or cross-system coordination needs
- **Context Understanding:** Any situation requiring project scope awareness

## MCP Sequential Thinking Integration

**Tool Integration:** Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for structured analysis with PROJECT CONTEXT:
- **Systematic Reasoning:** Step-by-step problem decomposition with intelligent-claude-code project scope
- **Multi-Factor Analysis:** Weighted decision matrices within AI-AGENTIC system context
- **Risk Assessment:** Structured risk identification for behavioral pattern system
- **Solution Comparison:** Objective evaluation with project constraints and goals
- **Project Context Injection:** ALWAYS include system nature (AI-AGENTIC), project root, and work boundaries

## Sequential Thinking Framework

### Problem Analysis Pattern
1. **Problem Definition:** Clear articulation of the challenge or decision requirement
2. **Context Analysis:** Relevant factors, constraints, dependencies, and requirements
3. **Factor Identification:** Key variables, decision points, and critical considerations
4. **Impact Assessment:** Potential consequences, risks, and benefits of different approaches
5. **Decision Framework:** Structured evaluation criteria and decision-making process
6. **Implementation Planning:** Step-by-step execution strategy with clear milestones

### Story Breakdown Sequential Pattern
**For Complex Stories (>10 points):**
1. **Requirements Analysis:** Break down user story into component requirements
2. **Dependency Mapping:** Identify technical and business dependencies
3. **Complexity Assessment:** Score each component using standard complexity metrics
4. **Logical Grouping:** Organize related functionality into coherent work units
5. **Sequential Ordering:** Establish proper execution sequence with dependencies
6. **AgentTask Generation:** Create appropriately-sized AgentTasks (â‰¤15 points each)

### Bug Investigation Sequential Pattern
**For All Bug Analysis:**
1. **Symptom Documentation:** Record observed behavior and error conditions
2. **Context Gathering:** Environment, inputs, expected vs actual behavior
3. **Root Cause Analysis:** Systematic investigation of potential causes
4. **Impact Assessment:** Scope of affected functionality and users
5. **Solution Evaluation:** Compare potential fixes and their trade-offs
6. **Implementation Planning:** Step-by-step remediation approach

## Integration with System Patterns

### AgentTask Creation Integration
**Sequential thinking enhances AgentTask generation:
- **Context Assembly:** Systematic gathering of all required context elements
- **Complexity Calculation:** Structured assessment of work complexity factors
- **Template Selection:** Logic-based template matching using complexity scores
- **Placeholder Resolution:** Systematic resolution of all template placeholders
- **Validation:** Comprehensive validation of AgentTask completeness and accuracy

### Memory Integration
**Store sequential thinking patterns:**
- **Successful Frameworks:** Capture effective analysis patterns for reuse
- **Decision Records:** Document reasoning patterns for similar future decisions
- **Learning Enhancement:** Store improved sequential thinking approaches
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify recurring analysis patterns across projects

### Role System Integration
**Sequential thinking supports role collaboration:**
- **PM Analysis:** Structured project coordination and priority assessment
- **Architect Decisions:** Systematic design evaluation and technology selection
- **Specialist Assessment:** Domain-specific analysis using structured approaches
- **Risk Evaluation:** Comprehensive risk assessment across all specialist domains

## Behavioral Rules

### Activation Rules
**LIBERAL AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION:** Sequential thinking automatically activates for:
- ANY multi-step reasoning or decision-making process
- ALL user request analysis to understand scope and context
- Simple task planning that benefits from structured approach
- Complex story breakdown requiring multi-factor analysis
- Bug investigation requiring systematic root cause analysis
- ALL AgentTask creation regardless of complexity (not just >2 points)
- Architecture decisions involving multiple technology choices
- Risk assessments requiring structured evaluation
- Understanding work requests within project boundaries

### Analysis Depth
**PROPORTIONAL RESPONSE:** Analysis depth matches problem complexity:
- **Simple Problems (2-5 points):** Basic 3-step analysis pattern
- **Medium Problems (6-10 points):** Standard 6-step sequential framework
- **Complex Problems (>10 points):** Full sequential analysis with MCP tool integration

### Quality Standards
**MANDATORY STANDARDS:** All sequential thinking must maintain:
- **Traceability:** Clear reasoning chain from problem to solution
- **Completeness:** All critical factors identified and evaluated
- **Objectivity:** Evidence-based analysis without bias
- **Actionability:** Clear next steps and implementation guidance
