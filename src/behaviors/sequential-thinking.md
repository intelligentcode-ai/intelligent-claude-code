# Sequential Thinking Behavior

**MANDATORY:** Structured analytical thinking for complex problems. Auto-correct violations.

## Imports
@./shared-patterns/behavioral-decision-matrix.md
@./shared-patterns/context-validation.md
@./shared-patterns/memory-operations.md

## Purpose
Structured analytical frameworks for problem decomposition, multi-factor analysis, and systematic reasoning.

## Triggers
Apply liberally for multi-step reasoning, request analysis, story breakdown (>10 points), bug investigation, AgentTask planning, architecture evaluation, risk assessment, integration analysis.

## MCP Integration
Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` with PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Systematic reasoning with project scope
- Multi-factor analysis within AI-AGENTIC system context
- Risk assessment for behavioral patterns
- Solution comparison with project constraints
- ALWAYS include system nature, project root, work boundaries

## Framework Patterns

### Problem Analysis (6 steps)
1. Problem definition → 2. Context analysis → 3. Factor identification → 4. Impact assessment → 5. Decision framework → 6. Implementation planning

### Story Breakdown (>10 points)
1. Requirements analysis → 2. Dependency mapping → 3. Complexity assessment → 4. Logical grouping → 5. Sequential ordering → 6. AgentTask generation

### Bug Investigation
1. Symptom documentation → 2. Context gathering → 3. Root cause analysis → 4. Impact assessment → 5. Solution evaluation → 6. Implementation planning

## Integration
- **AgentTask Creation**: Context assembly, complexity calculation, template selection, placeholder resolution, validation
- **Memory**: Store successful frameworks, decision records, improved approaches, recurring patterns
- **Role System**: PM analysis, architect decisions, specialist assessment, risk evaluation

## Activation Rules
Automatic activation for multi-step reasoning, user request analysis, all AgentTask creation, complex stories, bug investigation, architecture decisions, risk assessments.

**Analysis Depth**: Simple (3 steps), Medium (6 steps), Complex (full MCP integration).
