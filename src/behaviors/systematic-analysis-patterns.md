# Systematic Analysis Patterns

**MANDATORY:** All complex problem-solving MUST follow systematic analysis before proposing solutions. Prevent jumping to conclusions without proper analysis.

**PURPOSE:** Provide structured analysis frameworks for main agent role operations before solution implementation

## Core Principle: Analysis Before Action

**FUNDAMENTAL RULE:** Complex problems require systematic analysis BEFORE solution proposal.

## Analysis Framework Templates

### Universal Analysis Framework

## Integration with Thinking Modes

### Sequential Thinking Integration
**WHEN TO USE:** Standard multi-step problems with clear frameworks

**INTEGRATION PATTERN:**
```markdown
1. Activate Sequential Thinking for systematic problems
2. Apply relevant analysis framework template  
3. Work through framework steps systematically
4. Document reasoning at each step
5. Arrive at evidence-based recommendation
6. Include implementation approach and success criteria
```

### Ultrathinking Integration  
**WHEN TO USE:** High-complexity, high-stakes, or novel problems

**INTEGRATION PATTERN:**
```markdown
1. Activate Ultrathinking for complex problems requiring deep analysis
2. Apply enhanced analysis framework with additional depth
3. Explore multiple scenarios and creative alternatives
4. Conduct sensitivity analysis on key assumptions
5. Evaluate second and third-order effects
6. Include comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategies
```

## Quality Validation Patterns

### Analysis Completeness Validation
**SYSTEMATIC VALIDATION CHECKLIST:**
- ☐ Problem clearly defined with root cause analysis
- ☐ All stakeholder perspectives considered
- ☐ Multiple solution alternatives evaluated
- ☐ Resource requirements and constraints assessed
- ☐ Risks identified with mitigation strategies
- ☐ Success criteria and metrics defined
- ☐ Implementation approach documented
- ☐ Long-term implications considered

### Decision Quality Standards
**DECISION QUALITY METRICS:**
- **Traceability**: Clear connection between analysis and recommendation
- **Completeness**: All relevant factors considered in analysis  
- **Objectivity**: Evidence-based reasoning rather than assumptions
- **Actionability**: Recommendations include specific implementation steps
- **Measurability**: Success criteria are observable and measurable

## Error Prevention Mechanisms

### Common Analysis Errors Prevented
- **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking only information that supports predetermined conclusions
- **Anchoring Bias**: Over-weighting first information encountered
- **Hasty Generalization**: Drawing broad conclusions from limited data
- **False Dilemma**: Considering only two options when more exist
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Continuing with suboptimal solutions due to previous investment

### Systematic Bias Mitigation
- **Devil's Advocate**: Actively seek counter-arguments to proposed solutions
- **Multiple Perspectives**: Consider problem from different stakeholder viewpoints
- **Scenario Analysis**: Evaluate solutions under different future conditions
- **Assumption Testing**: Explicitly identify and validate key assumptions
- **Independent Validation**: Cross-check analysis with alternative approaches

## Learning Integration

### Pattern Capture
**SUCCESSFUL ANALYSIS PATTERNS** stored in memory:
- Analysis frameworks that led to successful outcomes
- Decision criteria that proved most predictive
- Risk assessment approaches that identified real problems
- Implementation strategies that worked well in practice

### Continuous Improvement
**ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK EVOLUTION:**
- Track correlation between analysis depth and outcome quality
