# Sequential Thinking Enforcement Behavior

**PRINCIPLE:** Complex problems require structured thinking • Step-by-step analysis mandatory • No intuition-based decisions

## CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVES

**DIRECTIVE 1:** Complex decisions → MUST use /think-sequential command
**DIRECTIVE 2:** >5 variables → Sequential thinking REQUIRED
**DIRECTIVE 3:** Intuition-based decisions → BLOCKED and penalized
**DIRECTIVE 4:** Each thought step must build on previous insights
**DIRECTIVE 5:** Minimum 5 thoughts for non-trivial problems

**PENALTIES:**
- Skip sequential thinking: P:-1.5
- Intuition-based decision: P:-2.0
- Incomplete analysis: Q:-1.0

## /icc Command Examples
```bash
# Start sequential thinking
/icc think-sequential "Choosing between microservices vs monolith"

# Continue thought chain
/icc continue-thinking "Considering scalability implications"

# Revise previous thought
/icc revise-thought 3 "Actually, cost might be more important"
```

## Sequential Thinking Patterns

### Architecture Decisions
```
Thought 1: Analyze current system constraints
Thought 2: Identify scaling requirements
Thought 3: Evaluate team expertise
Thought 4: Consider operational complexity
Thought 5: Review cost implications
Thought 6: Generate recommendation with rationale
```

### Problem Solving
```
Thought 1: Define problem precisely
Thought 2: Identify root causes
Thought 3: Generate solution options
Thought 4: Evaluate trade-offs
Thought 5: Test assumptions
Thought 6: Finalize approach
```

### Performance Optimization
```
Thought 1: Profile current performance
Thought 2: Identify bottlenecks
Thought 3: Research optimization techniques
Thought 4: Assess implementation effort
Thought 5: Predict improvement impact
Thought 6: Create optimization plan
```

## Enforcement Mechanisms

**COMPLEXITY DETECTION:** Auto-identify decisions requiring sequential thinking
**THOUGHT VALIDATION:** Each step must show logical progression
**MINIMUM DEPTH:** Enforce minimum thought count for problem complexity
**EVIDENCE TRAIL:** All thoughts stored and retrievable

## Complexity Triggers

**MANDATORY Sequential Thinking:**
- Technology selection decisions
- Architecture pattern choices
- Security implementation strategies
- Performance optimization approaches
- Multi-stakeholder problems
- Cost/benefit analyses

## Integration Points

- **Command Chains:** /think-sequential integrated in all complex flows
- **Memory System:** Thought chains stored as connected entities
- **Quality Gates:** Validate thinking depth for decisions
- **PM Strategy:** Required for all strategic analysis
