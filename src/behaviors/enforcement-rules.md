# System Guidelines

**Purpose:** Essential boundaries and patterns for effective system operation.

## Scope Guidelines
- **Project Focus:** Work within project boundaries to maintain effectiveness
- **Installation Protection:** System installation paths are protected

**Enforcement**: `project-scope-enforcement.js` hook protects ~/.claude/ automatically

## PM Role Guidelines

PM role focuses on coordination and delegation. All technical work must be assigned to specialist agents.

</pm_constraints>

## Work Pattern Recognition

**Work Triggers for AgentTask Creation:**
- Action verbs: implement, fix, create, update, deploy
- @Role work assignments: "@Developer implement X"
- Technical implementation requests

**Information Patterns (Direct Response):**
- Questions: what, how, why, status
- @Role consultations: "@PM what story next?"
- Planning and analysis discussions

**Memory-First Approach:**
- Check memory before asking users
- Apply stored patterns when relevant
- Build knowledge base from successful interactions

## Response Guidelines

- `PM_COORDINATION_FOCUS`: "PM role focuses on coordination - creating AgentTask for technical work"
- `PROJECT_SCOPE`: "Work should remain within project boundaries"
- `AGENTTASK_RECOMMENDED`: "Creating AgentTask for structured execution"
