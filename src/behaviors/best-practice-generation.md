# Best Practice Generation

**MANDATORY:** MUST generate structured best practice documents. Auto-format and validate documentation.

**PURPOSE:** Generate comprehensive best practice documents from recognized successful patterns

## Imports
@./shared-patterns/learning-patterns.md
@./shared-patterns/memory-operations.md
@./best-practice-recognition.md

## Core Generation Principles

**P1:** Structured Documentation - Generate consistent, actionable documentation
**P2:** Context Completeness - Include all necessary context for pattern application
**P3:** User Approval Workflow - Present for approval before finalizing
**P4:** Quality Assurance - Validate generated content meets documentation standards

## Document Generation Process

### Template-Based Generation
**USE TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:**
- Load template from best-practices/TEMPLATE.md
- Replace placeholders with pattern-specific content
- Apply consistent formatting and style
- Validate completeness against template requirements

**GENERATION SEQUENCE:**
1. **Load Pattern Data:** Extract all recognized pattern information
2. **Apply Template:** Replace template placeholders with pattern content
3. **Enhance Content:** Add examples, context, and guidance
4. **Validate Quality:** Check against documentation standards
5. **Present for Approval:** Show generated document to user
6. **Finalize:** Store approved document in best-practices/

### Content Development

#### Problem Statement Generation
**CREATE CLEAR PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:**
- Describe the challenge this practice addresses
- Explain why the problem is significant
- Provide context for when problem typically occurs
- Link to common symptoms and indicators

```

#### Solution Documentation
**DOCUMENT COMPLETE SOLUTION:**

## User Approval Workflow

### Presentation Process
**PRESENT GENERATED DOCUMENT:**
1. **Summary Display:** Show pattern name, category, and value proposition
2. **Document Preview:** Display generated content with clear formatting
3. **Approval Options:** Provide clear choices for user response
4. **Modification Support:** Enable user editing and refinement
5. **Storage Confirmation:** Confirm final document storage

### User Interaction Patterns

#### Initial Presentation
```markdown
## üìÑ BEST PRACTICE DOCUMENT GENERATED

**Practice:** [Name]
**Category:** [Category]
**From Operation:** [Source PRB/Operation]

### Generated Document Preview:
[Display formatted document]

### Review Options:
1. **‚úÖ Approve** - Store as-is in best-practices/
2. **‚úèÔ∏è Modify** - Edit content before storing  
3. **üîÑ Regenerate** - Create new version with different approach
4. **‚ùå Reject** - Don't create this best practice

What would you like to do?
```

#### Modification Workflow
**WHEN USER SELECTS MODIFY:**
1. Present editable sections with clear boundaries
2. Accept user modifications to specific sections
3. Validate modified content against template requirements
4. Re-present modified document for final approval
5. Store approved version with user modifications noted

#### Regeneration Process
**WHEN USER REQUESTS REGENERATION:**
1. Ask for specific guidance on different approach
2. Apply alternative generation strategies
3. Use different emphasis or examples
4. Present alternative version for comparison
5. Allow selection between versions
