# Learning Team Automation

**MANDATORY:** Use learnings and auto-correct violations.

## Imports
@./memory-system.md
@./best-practices-system.md

## Core Learning Process
Active learning tracking with proactive memory generation during all operations.

### Learning Capture
Store successful AgentTask patterns in memory/[topic]/[subtopic].md.
Types: Process improvements, knowledge transfers, issue prevention.

### Best-Practices Generation
Auto-generate from successful patterns (3+ uses, broad applicability).
Storage: best-practices/[category]/[practice-name].md.

### Proactive Triggers
- Information requests (check memory first)
- Configuration/path discoveries
- Problem resolution patterns
- Repeated questions (2+ times)
- Tool integration successes
- Workflow completions

### Security-Aware Storage
Store location methods, not credentials.
Store processes, not values.
NEVER store actual tokens, passwords, keys.

## AgentTask Integration
Memory-first generation → Automatic storage on completion → Pattern extraction.

### Automatic Storage Process
1. Scan execution for patterns worth capturing
2. Determine topic (work type, technology domain, problem category)
3. Extract reusable patterns (approaches, solutions, configurations)
4. Apply security validation before storage
5. Store using StoreInMemory with AgentTask context

### Auto-Application
Query intent → Memory search → Relevance scoring → Apply high-relevance memories → Store new learnings.
