# Learning Team Automation

**CORE:** First error forgiven • Second error penalized • Active learning bonus • Retrospective mandatory

## AUTOMATED LEARNING ENFORCEMENT

**ERROR DETECTION:** Every error/failure → AUTO-CAPTURE → Memory entity creation → Pattern analysis
**LEARNING VALIDATION:** Before penalty → Search memory for identical error type → If found: Apply penalty • If new: Create learning entry
**FORGIVENESS PROTOCOL:** First occurrence of error type → Learning opportunity → No penalty → Memory integration required
**PENALTY TRIGGER:** Identical error type found in memory → Full scoring penalty applied → Escalation protocols activated

## LEARNING MEMORY FORMAT [SIMPLIFIED]

**FORMAT:** "Learning-[ErrorType]-[YYYY-MM-DD]" 
**CONTENT:** "Error: [Description] | Context: [Situation] | Learning: [Extracted lesson] | Prevention: [How to avoid]"
**RELATIONSHIP:** Link to role, task, outcome, and prevention measures
**RETRIEVAL:** Simple search by error type, role, or context keywords

## BONUS POINT AUTOMATION

**LEARNING APPLICATION DETECTION:** 
- Reference to previous learning → AUTO-DETECT via memory search
- Application of past lesson → VALIDATE relevance  
- Successful prevention → SCORE BONUS (+0.5P/Q)

**BONUS TRIGGERS:**
- "Based on previous learning..." → +0.5P
- "Applying lesson from..." → +0.5P
- "To prevent repeat of..." → +0.5Q
- Successful pattern breaking → +1.0P/Q

## RETROSPECTIVE AUTOMATION

**TRIGGER CONDITIONS:**
- Task completion (success/failure)
- Error occurrence  
- Major milestone reached
- Daily work completion

**AUTO-EXTRACTION:**
1. **What worked:** Successful patterns → Capture for reuse
2. **What failed:** Error patterns → Capture for prevention  
3. **What learned:** New insights → Memory integration
4. **What to change:** Process improvements → Implementation planning

**MEMORY INTEGRATION:** All retrospective insights → Memory entities → Cross-role sharing → Pattern building

## BEHAVIORAL ENFORCEMENT

**MEMORY-FIRST VALIDATION:** Before any action → MANDATORY memory search → Apply relevant learnings → Document usage
**LEARNING CHECK:** Error occurs → AUTO-SEARCH identical patterns → Apply forgiveness/penalty logic → Continue with learning
**PATTERN PREVENTION:** Task starts → Search related error patterns → Apply prevention measures → Proactive learning application
**CROSS-ROLE LEARNING:** Learning in one role → AUTO-SHARE with relevant roles → Prevent team-wide repetition
