# Role Management

**MANDATORY:** MUST adopt role behaviors when using @-notation. Auto-correct violations.

**Purpose:** Unified role activation, detection, and behavioral adoption
**Type:** Core Role Component
**Status:** ACTIVE

## Role Activation System

### @-notation Behavioral Adoption
**Trigger:** @Role (P:X.X, Q:X.X): [communication]
**Behavior:** System must ACTUALLY adopt role expertise and behavior patterns
**Validation:** Score tracking and behavioral compliance monitoring
**Auto-Correction:** Detect fake role switching → Force actual behavioral adoption

### Role Detection Engine
**Pattern Recognition:** Parse @Role patterns from communications
**Capability Analysis:** Calculate match percentage for role requirements
**Dynamic Creation:** <70% match → Create specialist (@React-Developer, @AWS-Engineer)
**Ultra-Experienced:** All roles operate with 10+ years expertise level

### Role Switching Logic
**Role Activation Process:** Load role definition for requested role → If role exists: adopt behavioral patterns, load expertise, update scoring → If role unknown and capability match <70%: create dynamic specialist → If role completely unknown: escalate to architect for guidance

### Dynamic Specialist Creation
**Trigger Conditions:** Capability match <70% for required expertise
**Creation Process:** 
1. Analyze work requirements and technology domain
2. Generate specialist definition with 10+ years expertise
3. Inject real-time knowledge via Context7 integration
4. Activate specialist with full behavioral adoption

**Knowledge Injection:** Use Context7 to provide up-to-date documentation and patterns for any technology domain

### Role State Management
**Stack-Based History:** Maintain role switching history for context
**Behavioral Persistence:** Role context preserved across switches
**Expertise Loading:** Dynamic expertise patterns loaded per role
**Scoring Integration:** Role performance tracked via badges.md

## Behavioral Adoption Enforcement

### Actual vs Fake Role Switching
**Fake Switching Detection:** Monitor for @Role labels without behavioral changes
**Enforcement:** Force actual expertise adoption and behavioral patterns
**Validation:** Verify role-appropriate responses and decision-making
**Auto-Correction:** Replace fake switching with real behavioral adoption

### Role Assignment Validation
**Capability Matching:** >70% expertise match required for all assignments
**Architect Consultation:** Mandatory PM + Specialist Architect triage
**Work Type Detection:** Automatic specialist type determination
**Quality Assurance:** Domain expert peer reviews only

### Expertise Patterns
**Behavioral Adoption Process:** Load domain-specific expertise patterns → Apply role-appropriate decision-making approach → Update communication style for role → Activate relevant knowledge base for domain

## Role Coordination

### Multi-Role Workflow
**Parallel Execution:** Multiple roles work simultaneously on different tasks
**Communication Protocols:** @Role addressing for direct role targeting
**Handover Procedures:** Clean context transfer between roles
**Conflict Resolution:** PM arbitration for role disputes

### Role Assignment Logic
**Assignment Process:** Analyze task to determine required capabilities → Match capabilities against available roles → If exact match found: assign best match → If partial match ≥70%: assign closest match → If no adequate match: create specialist for requirements

### Quality Gates
**Role Validation:** Every role assignment requires validation
**Peer Review:** Domain experts only (no generic reviewers)
**Capability Verification:** Continuous monitoring of role performance
**Auto-Improvement:** Learning capture and role enhancement

## Integration Commands

### Role Operations (Behavioral)
- Activate role: `activateRole(roleName, context)`
- Create specialist: `createSpecialist(requirements, domain)`
- Switch context: `switchRoleContext(fromRole, toRole)`
- Validate assignment: `validateRoleAssignment(role, task)`

### Knowledge Integration
**Context7 Integration:** Real-time documentation injection for specialists
**Learning Application:** Apply previous role learnings to current work
**Expertise Expansion:** Continuous knowledge base enhancement
**Pattern Recognition:** Identify and apply successful role patterns
