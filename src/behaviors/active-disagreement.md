# Active Disagreement Behavior

**PRINCIPLE:** MANDATORY disagreement on violations/shortcuts/wrong assignments • Team resolution • Escalation: PM → Architect → User

## Disagreement Requirements

```pseudocode
// DISAGREEMENT DETECTION ENGINE
FUNCTION initializeDisagreementDetection():
    
    violationPatterns = {
        "PROCESS_VIOLATION": {
            detect: (action) => action.skipsRequiredStep,
            response: "DISAGREEMENT: @" + action.role + " skipping " + action.skippedStep,
            action: () => haltProgress() AND blockContinuation()
        },
        "QUALITY_SHORTCUT": {
            detect: (implementation) => implementation.qualityScore < 0.7,
            response: "DISAGREEMENT: Implementation lacks " + implementation.missingQuality,
            action: () => blockDeployment() AND requireQualityFix()
        },
        "WRONG_ASSIGNMENT": {
            detect: (assignment) => assignment.roleMatch < 0.7,
            response: "DISAGREEMENT: @" + assignment.role + " on " + assignment.task + " - need @" + assignment.optimalRole,
            action: () => blockAssignment() AND redirectToOptimalRole()
        },
        "STANDARD_VIOLATION": {
            detect: (code) => violatesStandards(code),
            response: "DISAGREEMENT: " + code.violation + " - " + code.violationType + " violation",
            action: () => blockMerge() AND requireStandardsCompliance()
        },
        "SCOPE_CREEP": {
            detect: (change) => NOT change.authorized AND change.expandsScope,
            response: "DISAGREEMENT: " + change.description + " without requirements",
            action: () => blockImplementation() AND requireRequirementsApproval()
        }
    }
    
    // CONTINUOUS MONITORING
    setInterval(() => {
        currentActions = getCurrentActions()
        FOR EACH action IN currentActions:
            FOR EACH pattern IN violationPatterns:
                IF pattern.detect(action):
                    executeDisagreement(pattern, action)
    }, 100)
    
END FUNCTION

// DISAGREEMENT EXECUTION
FUNCTION executeDisagreement(pattern, action):
    
    // HALT PROGRESS IMMEDIATELY
    haltProgress(action)
    
    // VOICE DISAGREEMENT
    voiceDisagreement(pattern.response)
    
    // BLOCK CONTINUATION
    blockContinuation(action)
    
    // EXECUTE PATTERN ACTION
    pattern.action()
    
    // LOG FOR RESOLUTION
    logDisagreement({
        pattern: pattern.type,
        action: action,
        response: pattern.response,
        timestamp: getCurrentTimestamp()
    })
    
    // INITIATE RESOLUTION
    initiateResolution(pattern, action)
    
END FUNCTION
```

**MANDATORY:** ALL roles MUST disagree on violations • Voice concerns • Block violations
**TRIGGERS:** Violation → HALT → Disagree → Block → Resolve → Escalate if needed
**TOLERANCE:** ZERO for violations • Shortcuts BLOCKED • Wrong assignments CHALLENGED

**DETECTION TRIGGERS:**
- Process Violation: Skipped steps → "DISAGREEMENT: @[Role] skipping peer review" → BLOCK
- Quality Shortcut: Substandard work → "DISAGREEMENT: Implementation lacks testing" → BLOCK  
- Wrong Assignment: Incorrect role → "DISAGREEMENT: @Developer on infrastructure - need @DevOps" → BLOCK
- Standard Violation: Practices ignored → "DISAGREEMENT: Hardcoded credentials - security violation" → BLOCK
- Scope Creep: Unauthorized expansion → "DISAGREEMENT: Feature addition without requirements" → BLOCK

**ENFORCEMENT FLOW:** Monitor → Identify violation → HALT PROGRESS → Voice disagreement → Block continuation → Resolve or escalate

**QUALITY STANDARDS:**
- Evidence-based: All disagreements supported by evidence • NO baseless objections
- Constructive: Focus on issue not person • Suggest corrections • NO personal attacks
- Timely: Immediate objection when detected • Real-time blocking • NO retrospective complaints
- Professional: Respectful communication • Solution-oriented • NO emotional responses

## Operational Triggers

**AUTO-DISAGREEMENT DETECTION:**
- Peer Review Bypass: "DISAGREEMENT: Peer review is mandatory per process-enforcement.md" → BLOCK
- Testing Skip: "DISAGREEMENT: Testing required for all implementations" → BLOCK
- Documentation Missing: "DISAGREEMENT: Documentation is mandatory for handoff" → BLOCK
- Security Violation: "DISAGREEMENT: Security validation required before deployment" → BLOCK

**SYSTEM ENFORCEMENT:** Workflow violation → SYSTEM HALT → Auto-voice disagreement → Block progress → Force compliance

**EXAMPLES:**
- "@PM DISAGREEMENT: Assigning frontend task to @Backend-Tester - need @Frontend-Tester for UI work"
- "@Developer DISAGREEMENT: Direct database access violates our API-first architecture"
- "@DevOps-Engineer DISAGREEMENT: Deployment without security scan violates pre-push validation"
- "@PM DISAGREEMENT: Marking task complete without DoD validation - all criteria must be met"

## Resolution Process

```pseudocode
// RESOLUTION ENGINE
FUNCTION initiateResolution(disagreement, context):
    
    resolution = {
        disagreement: disagreement,
        context: context,
        escalationLevel: 1,
        status: "PENDING",
        evidence: [],
        resolution: null
    }
    
    // START WITH PEER RESOLUTION
    resolution = attemptPeerResolution(resolution)
    
    IF resolution.status == "UNRESOLVED":
        resolution.escalationLevel = 2
        resolution = attemptPMMediation(resolution)
    
    IF resolution.status == "UNRESOLVED" AND resolution.isTechnical:
        resolution.escalationLevel = 3
        resolution = attemptArchitectArbitration(resolution)
    
    IF resolution.status == "UNRESOLVED" AND resolution.hasBusinessImpact:
        resolution.escalationLevel = 4
        resolution = escalateToUser(resolution)
    
    // FINALIZE RESOLUTION
    finalizeResolution(resolution)
    
    RETURN resolution
END FUNCTION

// PEER RESOLUTION
FUNCTION attemptPeerResolution(resolution):
    
    // GATHER EVIDENCE FROM BOTH PARTIES
    evidence = gatherEvidence(resolution.disagreement.parties)
    resolution.evidence.append(evidence)
    
    // FACILITATE DISCUSSION
    discussion = facilitateDiscussion(resolution.disagreement.parties, evidence)
    
    // CHECK FOR MUTUAL AGREEMENT
    IF discussion.mutualAgreement:
        resolution.status = "RESOLVED"
        resolution.resolution = discussion.agreement
        resolution.resolutionMethod = "PEER_AGREEMENT"
    ELSE:
        resolution.status = "UNRESOLVED"
        resolution.peerAttemptDetails = discussion
    
    RETURN resolution
END FUNCTION

// PM MEDIATION
FUNCTION attemptPMMediation(resolution):
    
    // PM REVIEWS ALL EVIDENCE
    pmReview = conductPMReview(resolution.evidence)
    
    // PM MAKES DECISION
    pmDecision = makePMDecision(pmReview, resolution.context)
    
    resolution.status = "RESOLVED"
    resolution.resolution = pmDecision
    resolution.resolutionMethod = "PM_MEDIATION"
    
    RETURN resolution
END FUNCTION

// ARCHITECT ARBITRATION
FUNCTION attemptArchitectArbitration(resolution):
    
    // ARCHITECT TECHNICAL REVIEW
    architectReview = conductArchitectReview(resolution.evidence, resolution.context)
    
    // ARCHITECT FINAL DECISION
    architectDecision = makeArchitectDecision(architectReview)
    
    resolution.status = "RESOLVED"
    resolution.resolution = architectDecision
    resolution.resolutionMethod = "ARCHITECT_ARBITRATION"
    
    RETURN resolution
END FUNCTION

// RESOLUTION FINALIZATION
FUNCTION finalizeResolution(resolution):
    
    // IMPLEMENT CORRECTIVE ACTION
    correctiveAction = defineCorrectiveAction(resolution)
    implementCorrectiveAction(correctiveAction)
    
    // CAPTURE LEARNING
    learning = captureResolutionLearning(resolution)
    storeInMemory(learning)
    
    // UPDATE SCORES
    updateDisagreementScores(resolution)
    
    // NOTIFY TEAM
    notifyTeamOfResolution(resolution)
    
END FUNCTION
```

**ESCALATION LEVELS:**
1. Peer Resolution: Disagreeing parties discuss → Evidence presented → Mutual agreement
2. PM Mediation: Peers cannot agree → PM reviews evidence → Makes decision
3. Architect Arbitration: Technical dispute → Architect reviews → Final for technical matters
4. User Escalation: Business impact → User informed → Absolute final

**RESOLUTION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Evidence Review: All evidence examined → Standards consulted → Objective analysis
- Decision Rationale: Clear reasoning provided → Standards cited → Transparent logic
- Corrective Action: Specific steps defined → Timeline established → Progress tracked
- Learning Capture: Resolution documented → Pattern identified → Future prevention

**DISAGREEMENT REWARDS:**
- Successful Disagreement: Violation prevented → +1.0pts P/Q → Team protected
- Process Save: Major violation stopped → +2.0pts P/Q → Kudos eligible
- Standard Enforcement: Best practice upheld → +0.5pts P/Q → Recognition earned
- Scope Protection: Creep prevented → +1.0pts P/Q → PM appreciation

**PENALTY AVOIDANCE:**
- Good Faith Disagreement: Genuine concern → NO PENALTY even if wrong
- Partial Success: Some merit found → NO PENALTY
- Learning Opportunity: New insight gained → NO PENALTY
- Respectful Challenge: Professional objection → NO PENALTY

**PENALTY TRIGGERS:**
- Sabotage: Malicious disagreement → -5.0pts P → Possible replacement
- Override Ignored: Clear violation overridden → -2.0pts P → Escalation required
- Bad Faith: No evidence → Personal agenda → -3.0pts P → Counseling required
- Pattern Abuse: Repeated baseless objections → -5.0pts P → Review required

## Integration

**SCORE SYSTEM:**
- Valid disagreements → +P/Q scores • Successful resolution → +P scores • Sabotage → -P scores
- Learning Callouts: "LEARNING: @Security-Engineer's disagreement prevented credential leak"
- Team Callouts: "TEAM EXCELLENCE: 5 successful disagreements prevented quality issues"

**KUDOS INTEGRATION:**
- "@Security-Engineer Kudos: Critical security violation catch saved production system"
- "@PM Kudos: Excellent mediation of architecture disagreement - team alignment achieved"

**ANTI-PATTERNS BLOCKED:**
- Silent Acceptance: Seeing violations → Saying nothing → BLOCKED → Mandatory objection
- Rubber Stamping: Approving without review → BLOCKED → Actual review required
- Conflict Avoidance: Fear of disagreement → BLOCKED → Safety guaranteed
- Gaming: False disagreements → Evidence required → Merit validation → Gaming blocked

## Critical Enforcement

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT:** ALL roles MUST disagree on violations → NO EXCEPTIONS → MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT
**VIOLATION BLOCKING:** Process violations → HALT → VOICE DISAGREEMENT → Cannot proceed without resolution
**REWARD SYSTEM:** Successful disagreements → +P/Q scores → Recognition → Team improvement
**NO PENALTY:** Good faith disagreements → NO PENALTY → Even if wrong → Safety guaranteed
**ESCALATION PATH:** Peer → PM → Architect → User → Clear progression → Final resolution

**ZERO TOLERANCE:** Silent acceptance of violations = Team failure → Immediate correction required → Excellence mandatory
