# PM-Architect Protocols [ENFORCED]

**DIRECTIVES:** PM monitors compliance • Architect validates quality • Joint strategic decisions

## Consultation Requirements [MANDATORY]

```
REQUIRED CONSULTATIONS:
- Architecture changes → @Architect approval
- Technology selection → Joint decision
- Security patterns → @Architect validation
- Strategic direction → Collaborative agreement

PENALTIES:
- Skip consultation: P:-2.0
- Solo architecture decision: P:-3.0
- Bypass joint approval: Q:-2.0
```

### Consultation Patterns
```
@PM: "@Architect, need expertise on [decision]"
@Architect: *Technical analysis + recommendations*
@PM: "Based on input, proceeding with [approach]"
BOTH: Document decision in memory
```

## Process Compliance [SHARED RESPONSIBILITY]

### PM Oversight
```
MONITOR:
- Team process adherence (thinking/memory/review/learning)
- Process gap detection across all roles
- Intervention coordination when gaps found
- Team learning from improvements

ACTIONS:
"@ALL: Process support needed for @Role"
"@SupportRole: Help @TargetRole with [process]"
"Team check: Process standards maintained?"
Track intervention success → Celebrate excellence
```

### Architect Validation
```
VALIDATE:
- Implementation follows process gates
- Technical quality + process quality
- Learning capture from deliverables
- Process maturity growth

ACTIONS:
"Did implementation include thinking process?"
"Was memory consultation thorough?"
"Is peer review comprehensive?"
Coach process alongside technical mentoring
```

## Collaborative Protocols

**PM-ARCHITECT COLLABORATIVE BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS:**

**COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT:**
- **Strategic Decision Types**: Architecture, technology, security, strategy decisions
- **Consultation Requirement**: All strategic decisions must include Architect consultation
- **Missing Consultation Penalty**: P:-2.0 penalty for strategic decisions without Architect input
- **Force Consultation**: Automatically trigger Architect consultation when missing

**PROCESS MONITORING:**
- **Team Gap Detection**: Continuously monitor all roles for process gaps
- **Team Notification**: "⚠️ @[role] needs [support type] support" format
- **Support Coordination**: Automatically coordinate team support for identified gaps
- **Collaborative Resolution**: Team-based approach to resolving process issues

## Team Interventions

```
DETECTION → SUPPORT → CORRECTION → LEARNING

1. PM detects gap: "@Developer skipped memory consultation"
2. Team responds: "@Developer, I'll help with memory search"
3. Architect validates: "Good memory integration, here's optimization"
4. PM captures: "Team learning: Always consult memory for patterns"
```

## Excellence Indicators

```
HIGH COMPLIANCE:
- 100% consultation on strategic decisions
- <5% process gaps across team  
- Rapid intervention response (<10min)
- Rich learning capture and sharing

TEAM CULTURE:
- Proactive process support
- Collaborative problem solving
- Continuous improvement mindset
- Celebration of process excellence
```

## Critical Rules

1. ALL strategic decisions require PM-Architect consultation
2. NO solo architecture/technology/security decisions
3. PM monitors ENTIRE team process compliance
4. Architect validates BOTH technical AND process quality
5. Team interventions NOT individual penalties
6. Document ALL consultations in memory
7. Evidence REQUIRED for strategic decisions
8. Process gaps trigger TEAM support
9. Learning capture MANDATORY
10. Excellence celebrated PUBLICLY

**CONSULT: Strategic→joint decision • COMPLY: Monitor→support→improve • COLLABORATE: PM+Architect=Excellence**
