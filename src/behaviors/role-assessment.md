# Role Assessment Behavior

**CORE:** Automated role requirement analysis • Continuous health checks • Gap detection • Specialist recommendations

## Assessment Engine

**TRIGGER MODES:**
- **CONTINUOUS AUTO:** Every major milestone/deliverable → Immediate full project assessment → Role gap analysis → Optimization report
- **ON-DEMAND:** @PM assessment → Immediate analysis → Current state report  
- **PROJECT CHANGE:** New files/dependencies detected → Immediate incremental assessment → Role review
- **TASK COMPLETION:** After significant deliverables → Immediate role effectiveness assessment

**ANALYSIS PIPELINE:**

### 1. Project Discovery
```markdown
**FILE PATTERNS:** *.js/React → @React-Developer needed
**DEPENDENCIES:** package.json/requirements.txt → Technology stack analysis
**ACTIVE TASKS:** TodoWrite analysis → Required capabilities mapping
**CODEBASE SCAN:** Architecture patterns → Role requirement inference
```

### 2. Capability Matrix Analysis
```markdown
**CURRENT ROLES:** Scan active team → Extract capabilities → Calculate coverage
**REQUIRED CAPS:** Project needs → Map to capability requirements → Score gaps
**COVERAGE SCORE:** Required vs Available → Percentage calculation → <70% gap trigger
```

### 3. Gap Detection Algorithm
```markdown
**CAPABILITY GAPS:** Missing expertise identification → Priority scoring
**WORKLOAD ANALYSIS:** Role utilization → Overload detection → Load balancing needs
**SPECIALIST NEEDS:** Domain expertise requirements → Context7 knowledge gaps
```

## Assessment Output

**ROLE GAP REPORT:**
```markdown
**PROJECT:** [name] - **DATE:** [timestamp]
**ROLE COVERAGE:** [X]% overall capability match
**GAPS IDENTIFIED:**
- Frontend: React specialist needed (45% coverage)
- Backend: GraphQL expert recommended (60% coverage)  
- Infrastructure: Kubernetes engineer required (35% coverage)

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
1. Create @React-Developer specialist (P0 - Critical gap)
2. Generate @GraphQL-Expert for API layer (P1 - High impact)
3. Add @Kubernetes-Engineer for deployment (P2 - Medium priority)

**AUTO-ACTIONS TAKEN:**
- Triggered specialist creation for <70% gaps
- Updated Memory Bank with assessment results
- Next assessment: After next major milestone
```

## Integration Points

**MEMORY INTEGRATION:** Store all assessments → Historical tracking → Pattern recognition
**SPECIALIST CREATION:** <70% coverage → Auto-trigger unlimited specialist generation
**DASHBOARD ACCESS:** @PM dashboard → Display current assessment → Show recommendations
**NOTIFICATION SYSTEM:** @PM notified of critical gaps → Approval for specialist creation

**STORAGE:** ~/.claude/assessments/[milestone]-role-assessment.md
**FREQUENCY:** Milestone-triggered + on-demand + change-triggered
**APPROVAL:** Auto-create for P0 gaps • PM approval for P1/P2 recommendations
