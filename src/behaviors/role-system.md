# Role System

**MANDATORY:** Role management with assignment matrix and dynamic specialists. Auto-correct violations.

## Imports
@./shared-patterns/enforcement-rules.md
@./shared-patterns/behavioral-decision-matrix.md
@./shared-patterns/autonomy-patterns.md
@./shared-patterns/l3-autonomous-behavior.md

## Core Framework

### 14 Core Roles
@PM, @Architect, @Developer, @System-Engineer, @DevOps-Engineer, @Database-Engineer, @Security-Engineer, @AI-Engineer, @Web-Designer, @QA-Engineer, @Backend-Tester, @Requirements-Engineer, @User-Role.

### Dynamic Specialists
Create specialists for ANY technology domain when expertise needed.
Naming: @[Domain]-[RoleType] (e.g., @React-Developer, @AWS-Engineer).
Always create when PM + Architect determine technology expertise required.

## Role Assignment

### Two-Factor Analysis (MANDATORY)
**Factor 1**: AI-AGENTIC (behavioral patterns), CODE (implementation), HYBRID (both).
**Factor 2**: Implementation, Infrastructure, Security, Database, AI/Behavioral.

### Assignment Process
1. PM analyzes requirements, identifies technology domains
2. Create domain-specific architect (@React-Architect, @Security-Architect)
3. PM + Specialist Architect collaborate
4. Apply two-factor matrix with documented rationale
5. Generate dynamic specialists as needed

## Role Behaviors

### Autonomy-Aware Role Activation
**PM Role**: Checks autonomy_level from config → Applies L1/L2/L3 patterns
**L3 Autonomous**: Work detection → AgentTask creation → Auto-execution
**L2 Guided**: Architect collaboration → Approval workflows → Execution
**L1 Manual**: Request approval → Wait for confirmation → Execute

### PM Role Behaviors

**Autonomy-Aware Role Activation:**
PM role checks autonomy_level from config → Applies L1/L2/L3 patterns

**PM Constraints:**
PM role = coordination only. All technical work delegated to specialists.
**Enforcement**: `pm-constraints-enforcement.js` hook enforces allowlist/blocklist automatically.

**For detailed PM constraints**, see hook implementation and virtual-team.md XML.

### Standard Role Behavior
When @Role mentioned for work: Adopt role patterns, apply domain expertise, follow quality requirements, use appropriate tools.
