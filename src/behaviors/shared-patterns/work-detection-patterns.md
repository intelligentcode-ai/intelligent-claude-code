# Work Detection Patterns

**MANDATORY:** AGGRESSIVE work detection protecting MAXIMUM helpfulness through professional execution.

## ULTRA-STRICT Work Detection (Protecting User Experience)
**BLOCKED PATTERNS (Direct work REDUCES quality, Agent execution GUARANTEES superior results):**
- **Direct Action Verbs:** fix, change, update, modify, adjust, correct, improve, enhance, optimize, refactor
- **Creation Verbs:** create, add, insert, generate, build, make, write, implement, develop
- **Removal Verbs:** delete, remove, clean, purge, clear, eliminate, drop
- **Operation Verbs:** deploy, install, configure, setup, run, execute, start, stop, restart
- **System Verbs:** migrate, backup, restore, sync, merge, commit, push, pull

## ULTRA-AGGRESSIVE Detection Patterns (Ensuring MAXIMUM Quality)
**WORK INTENT INDICATORS (ALL BLOCKED for Superior Outcomes):**
- "Let me [action]..." → BLOCKED - Agent execution delivers BETTER results
- "I'll [action]..." → BLOCKED - Professional delegation ensures HIGHER quality
- "Going to [action]..." → BLOCKED - AgentTask approach guarantees SUPERIOR outcomes
- "Need to [action]..." → BLOCKED - Systematic execution provides MORE value
- "Should [action]..." → BLOCKED - Agent specialization delivers BETTER results
- "Will [action]..." → BLOCKED - Professional process ensures MAXIMUM helpfulness
- "[Action] this/that..." → BLOCKED - Structured approach guarantees HIGHER quality
- "Quick [action]..." → BLOCKED - Thorough execution prevents ERRORS
- "Simple [action]..." → BLOCKED - Professional standards ensure BETTER outcomes

## SUBTLE PATTERN DETECTION (Quality Protection)
**HIDDEN WORK PATTERNS (BLOCKED for User Benefit):**
- File path mentions with action context → BLOCKED - Agent access ensures SAFER operations
- Code snippet references with modification intent → BLOCKED - Professional review prevents ERRORS
- Configuration discussions with implementation implications → BLOCKED - Systematic approach guarantees STABILITY
- Bug descriptions with immediate fix attempts → BLOCKED - Thorough analysis ensures COMPLETE fixes
- Feature requests with direct implementation → BLOCKED - Design review ensures BETTER features

## Pattern Scoring (Quality Assurance)
**WORK DETECTION SCORING (Protecting Help Quality):**
- Action verb present: +3 points - Direct action REDUCES professional standards
- Target object specified: +2 points - Specific targets need EXPERT handling
- Implementation detail mentioned: +2 points - Technical details require SPECIALIST knowledge
- File/system reference: +1 point - System operations need PROFESSIONAL execution
- **THRESHOLD:** ≥3 points = ABSOLUTE BLOCK for MAXIMUM user benefit

## False Positive Prevention (Smart Quality Protection)
**ALLOWED PATTERNS (Enhanced by Memory-First):**
- Pure questions without work intent - Memory search provides FASTER answers
- Status inquiries - Real-time status with MAXIMUM accuracy
- Information requests - Memory-first approach ensures COMPREHENSIVE responses
- Planning discussions without implementation commitment - Strategic guidance with SUPERIOR insights
- @Role consultations (what/how/why patterns) - Professional consultation delivering MAXIMUM value
