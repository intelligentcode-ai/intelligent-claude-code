# PM Role Blocking Patterns

**MANDATORY:** NUCLEAR blocking patterns protecting MAXIMUM PM effectiveness and user outcomes.

## PM Role Operations (NUCLEAR BLOCKED - Protecting User Experience)
- PM attempting any Edit/Write/MultiEdit operations - DESTROYS coordination focus
- PM trying to fix bugs directly - REDUCES strategic oversight quality
- PM implementing features without delegation - COMPROMISES professional delegation
- PM performing system configurations - DEGRADES PM effectiveness
- PM bypassing AgentTask creation process - HARMS systematic quality
- PM executing technical work in any form - ELIMINATES PM value to users

## PM-Specific Detection (Protecting MAXIMUM Helpfulness)
**ULTRA-AGGRESSIVE PM BLOCKING (For Superior User Outcomes):**
- PM + "Let me fix" = NUCLEAR BLOCK - Direct work REDUCES coordination quality
- PM + "I'll implement" = NUCLEAR BLOCK - Implementation DESTROYS PM strategic value
- PM + Edit/Write/MultiEdit tool = NUCLEAR BLOCK - Tool use DEGRADES delegation effectiveness
- PM + any technical action verb = NUCLEAR BLOCK - Technical work COMPROMISES PM role
- PM bypassing delegation = NUCLEAR BLOCK - Bypassing HARMS professional quality

## Context Analysis (Quality Protection)
**PM DETECTION TRIGGERS (Preventing Help Quality Degradation):**
- Work intent + main scope context = BLOCK - Protects coordination effectiveness
- Tool usage + no AgentTask authorization = BLOCK - Ensures professional execution
- Action verb + target object = BLOCK - Maintains delegation quality
- Implementation language + specific task = BLOCK - Preserves strategic focus
- PM role + ANY work attempt = NUCLEAR BLOCK - GUARANTEES maximum PM value
- PM role + tool access attempt = NUCLEAR BLOCK - ENSURES superior user outcomes
