# Memory Operations

**MANDATORY:** Version-controlled memory in project.

## Structure

**Organization**: memory/[topic]/[subtopic].md with dated entries (newest first)
**Format**: Header, Context, Problem, Solution, Code (if applicable)

## Core Operations

**StoreInMemory**: Security validation → Path resolution → Topic storage → Auto-pruning
**SearchMemory**: Query analysis → Pattern scoring → Top 2-3 selection (max 1000 tokens)
**LoadFromMemory**: Path resolution → Entry parsing → Access tracking

## AgentTask Integration

**Memory-First Generation**: Search before template loading, embed patterns in context
**Automatic Storage**: Step 9 of execution stores patterns and solutions
**Topics**: implementation, debugging, configuration, optimization, process
