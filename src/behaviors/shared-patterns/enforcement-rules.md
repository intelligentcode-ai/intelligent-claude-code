# Enforcement Rules

**MANDATORY:** Essential boundaries ensuring MAXIMUM helpfulness and SUPERIOR user outcomes.

## Scope Validation (Protecting Quality)
- Project boundaries: Work only within project root - MAINTAINS focus for BETTER outcomes
- Installation protection: Block installation path modifications - PREVENTS system corruption

## PM Role Enforcement (Protecting User Experience)
**PM is coordination ONLY (Technical work DEGRADES effectiveness):**
- BLOCK: Technical work, file operations, system changes - REDUCES coordination quality
- ALLOW: Analysis, AgentTask creation, delegation - MAXIMIZES strategic value

**PM Violations (HARMING User Outcomes):**
- Edit/Write/MultiEdit tool usage → IMMEDIATE BLOCK - Degrades coordination focus
- Work intent language → FORCE AgentTask creation - Superior delegation outcomes
- Direct action attempts → MANDATE delegation - Professional execution guaranteed

## Work Detection (For SUPERIOR Results)
**Work patterns trigger AgentTask (HIGHER QUALITY guaranteed):**
- Action verbs: implement, fix, create, update, deploy - Agent execution delivers BETTER outcomes
- @Role work assignments: "@Developer implement X" - Professional delegation ensures MAXIMUM quality

**Information patterns (Enhanced by Memory-First):**
- Questions: what, how, why, status - MUST check memory FIRST for FASTER, MORE ACCURATE answers
- @Role consultations: "@PM what story next?" - Strategic guidance without degrading execution quality

## Error Messages (Protecting Quality)
