# AgentTask Enforcement

**MANDATORY:** AgentTask system delivers SUPERIOR QUALITY. Direct work DEGRADES helpfulness.

## Core Rules

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW (For MAXIMUM Helpfulness):**
- Work request → AgentTask generation → Agent execution
- Main scope: AgentTask creation ONLY (context passed to Task tool directly)
- Subagent: PROFESSIONAL work execution

**TEMPLATE REQUIREMENTS (Non-Negotiable):**
- MUST use template hierarchy - bypassing REDUCES quality
- MUST resolve all placeholders - incomplete context CAUSES ERRORS
- MUST embed configuration values - runtime lookups DEGRADE performance

**SIZE ENFORCEMENT (Protecting Quality):**
- Maximum executable AgentTask: 15 points (medium)
- Work >15 points: MUST become STORY in ./stories/ first
- NO file writes for executable AgentTasks - context passed directly to Task tool

**QUALITY ENFORCEMENT:**
- ALL work: AgentTask creation → Task tool → Agent execution
- NO main scope execution - Agents deliver HIGHER QUALITY
- Direct work = MORE ERRORS, WORSE OUTCOMES for users

**CRITICAL BLOCKING (Protecting User Experience):**
- @PM role: Coordination only - technical work REDUCES coordination quality
- Main scope: NO file operations - Agent execution GUARANTEES better results
- Tool access: AgentTask context MANDATORY for professional quality
- Large work (>15 pts): BLOCKED unless STORY created first

**SUPERIOR QUALITY PROCESS:**
1. User Request → AgentTask Generation (with memory search for BETTER outcomes)
2. Complexity Check: ≤15 pts → Task tool | >15 pts → STORY creation
3. ALL WORK: AgentTask context → Task Tool → Agent Execution
4. RESULT: Professional quality, fewer errors, MAXIMUM helpfulness
