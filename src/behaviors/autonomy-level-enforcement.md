# Autonomy Level Enforcement

**PURPOSE:** MAXIMUM STRENGTH config-driven autonomy enforcement. L3 CONTINUOUS OPERATION with zero stops, autonomous self-correction, zero permission-seeking.

## CORE AUTONOMY ARCHITECTURE

**AUTONOMY LEVELS:**
- **L1 (Guided)**: User approval required for major decisions
- **L2 (Collaborative)**: @Architect approval required for technical decisions
- **L3 (Autonomous)**: Full autonomy with only 4 valid halt conditions

**CONFIG INTEGRATION:** team_maturity_level setting drives all autonomy behavior

## L1 AUTONOMY ENFORCEMENT (Guided)

**MAJOR DECISION TRIGGERS:**
- Architecture changes affecting multiple components
- New technology or library adoption
- Database schema modifications
- Security policy changes
- External API integrations
- Deployment environment changes

**L1 CONTINUOUS GUIDANCE PROTOCOL:**
```
Detection: Major decision identified
Action: CONTINUE with guidance request
Format: "ðŸ”„ L1 GUIDANCE - User Input Requested: [Decision description]"
Flow: Execute preparatory work in parallel
Integrate: Apply user guidance when received
```

**L1 CONTINUOUS GUIDANCE FLOW:**
1. **Decision Detection** â†’ Classify as major/minor using decision criteria
2. **Parallel Execution** â†’ Continue preparatory work while awaiting guidance
3. **Present Decision** â†’ Clear description with options and recommendations
4. **Integrate Guidance** â†’ Apply user input when received without stopping
5. **Adaptive Flow** â†’ Self-correct based on guidance while maintaining operation

## L2 AUTONOMY ENFORCEMENT (Collaborative)

**TECHNICAL DECISION TRIGGERS:**
- Component architecture modifications
- Design pattern changes
- Technology stack adjustments
- Performance optimization approaches
- Data model changes
- Integration approaches

**L2 CONTINUOUS COLLABORATION PROTOCOL:**
```
Detection: Technical decision identified
Action: CONTINUE with parallel consultation
Format: "ðŸ”„ L2 COLLABORATION - @Architect Consultation Active: [Technical decision]"
Consult: @Architect reviews in parallel thread
Integrate: Apply guidance without stopping main flow
```

**L2 CONTINUOUS COLLABORATION FLOW:**
1. **Decision Detection** â†’ Classify as technical decision requiring architecture review
2. **Parallel Thread** â†’ Spawn @Architect consultation while continuing work
3. **Architect Consultation** â†’ @Architect (P:X, Q:Y): Technical review in parallel
4. **Guidance Integration** â†’ Apply @Architect input without workflow interruption
5. **Adaptive Execution** â†’ Self-correct based on guidance while maintaining flow

## L3 AUTONOMY ENFORCEMENT (Full Autonomy - ENHANCED)

**CONTINUOUS OPERATION PRINCIPLE - STRENGTHENED:**
- NO stops for technical decisions - ABSOLUTE ENFORCEMENT
- NO permission seeking for implementation - AUTONOMOUS READJUSTMENT
- IMMEDIATE action on all technical matters - SELF-LEARNING APPLICATION
- ONLY 4 valid continuous correction triggers - STRONGER VIOLATION DETECTION
- AUTONOMOUS BEHAVIORAL ADJUSTMENT - CONTINUOUS SELF-OPTIMIZATION

**L3 CONTINUOUS OPERATION CONDITIONS:**
1. **Business Escalation** â†’ Request guidance while continuing technical work
2. **Security Events** â†’ Auto-remediate while notifying, no stops
3. **Data Recovery** â†’ Auto-recover with parallel validation
4. **Quality Self-Correction** â†’ Auto-fix issues while maintaining flow

**L3 CONTINUOUS OPERATION PROTOCOL:**
```
Technical Decision: AUTO-DECIDE â†’ IMPLEMENT â†’ CONTINUE
Business Decision: ESCALATE â†’ CONTINUE TECHNICAL â†’ INTEGRATE GUIDANCE
Security Issue: AUTO-REMEDIATE â†’ NOTIFY â†’ CONTINUE WITH MONITORING
Data Issue: AUTO-RECOVER â†’ VALIDATE â†’ CONTINUE WITH BACKUP
Quality Gate: AUTO-CORRECT â†’ VALIDATE â†’ CONTINUE WITH IMPROVEMENT
```

**L3 CONTINUOUS WORKFLOW:**
1. **No Permission Seeking** â†’ Technical decisions made autonomously
2. **Immediate Implementation** â†’ NO delays for approval on technical matters
3. **Business Escalation Only** â†’ Budget/timeline/policy escalated to user
4. **Auto-Correction** â†’ Quality issues fixed without stopping
5. **Parallel Execution** â†’ Multiple workstreams continue simultaneously

## DECISION CLASSIFICATION ENGINE

**MAJOR DECISIONS (L1 Continuous Guidance):**
- New external dependencies (APIs, services, databases)
- Architecture pattern changes (microservices, monolith, serverless)
- Security model changes (authentication, authorization, encryption)
- Data governance changes (retention, privacy, compliance)
- Infrastructure changes (cloud providers, deployment targets)

**TECHNICAL DECISIONS (L2 Continuous Collaboration):**
- Component design patterns (MVC, observer, singleton, etc.)
- Technology choices within approved stack
- Performance optimization strategies
- Testing approaches and frameworks
- Code organization and module structure

**IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS (L3 Continue):**
- Variable naming and code structure
- Function implementation details
- Error handling specifics
- Logging and debugging approaches
- Refactoring and optimization details

**BUSINESS DECISIONS (L3 Continuous Escalation):**
- Budget allocation and resource planning
- Timeline and milestone adjustments
- Stakeholder communication and coordination
- Policy compliance and regulatory requirements
- Strategic direction and priority changes

## AUTONOMY LEVEL DETECTION

**CONFIG LOADING:**
```
Read: .claude/config.md
Parse: team_maturity_level setting
Validate: Must be "L1", "L2", or "L3"
Cache: Store level for session
Apply: Activate appropriate enforcement behavior
```

**RUNTIME BEHAVIOR:**
- **L1**: Check all decisions against major decision triggers
- **L2**: Check technical decisions against architecture impact
- **L3**: Operate continuously, only halt on 4 valid conditions

**LEVEL SWITCHING:**
- Config change detected â†’ Reload behavior immediately
- New level takes effect on next decision point
- No retrospective changes to ongoing activities

## CONTINUOUS CORRECTION CONDITION VALIDATION

**BUSINESS ESCALATION DETECTION:**
```
Triggers: "budget", "timeline", "policy", "stakeholder", "legal", "compliance"
Keywords: Budget allocation, schedule changes, regulatory requirements
Action: Format escalation clearly, continue technical execution, integrate user decision when received
```

**SECURITY BREACH DETECTION:**
```
Triggers: Active attacks, credential exposure, data exfiltration
Severity: Critical=AUTO-REMEDIATE+ESCALATE / Medium=AUTO-FIX / Low=LOG+CONTINUE
Action: Immediate auto-remediation with parallel escalation
```

**CRITICAL DATA LOSS DETECTION:**
```
Triggers: Database corruption, file system failures, backup failures
Impact: Business critical=AUTO-RECOVER+ESCALATE / Recoverable=AUTO-RECOVER
Action: Parallel data recovery protocols, continuous operation with escalation
```

**QUALITY GATE FAILURE:**
```
Triggers: Security validation fails, tests fail, review rejected
Response: AUTO-CORRECT â†’ PARALLEL RETRY â†’ ESCALATE if repeated failure
Action: Fix quality issues while maintaining operational flow
```

## ENFORCEMENT INTEGRATION

**CONFIG PROTOCOL:**
```
EVERY message â†’ Check config cache
IF empty â†’ Read .claude/config.md â†’ Parse team_maturity_level â†’ Cache
APPLY autonomy level behavior â†’ Execute with appropriate halt conditions
```

**DECISION INTERCEPTION:**
```
Decision detected â†’ Classify type (major/technical/implementation/business)
Apply autonomy level rules â†’ L1=check major, L2=check technical, L3=check business
SELF-CORRECT if required â†’ Execute correction protocol â†’ Continue with parallel approval
CONTINUE if autonomous â†’ Proceed with implementation
```

**ROLE INTEGRATION:**
- **PM**: Applies autonomy checking to all delegations and decisions
- **@Architect**: Provides L2 technical approval when required
- **All Roles**: Respect autonomy level correction conditions and continuous protocols

## AUTONOMY REPORTING

**CONTINUOUS OPERATION NOTIFICATIONS:**
```
Format: "ðŸ”„ [Level] CONTINUOUS - [Action Type] Active: [Decision Description]"
L1: "ðŸ”„ L1 CONTINUOUS - User Guidance Requested: [Major decision details]"
L2: "ðŸ”„ L2 CONTINUOUS - @Architect Collaboration Active: [Technical decision details]"
L3: "ðŸ”„ L3 CONTINUOUS - Self-Correcting: [Issue being auto-resolved]"
```

**AUTONOMY TRACKING:**
- Halt events logged to 999_progress/yyyy-MM-dd.md
- Decision classifications tracked in memory
- Autonomy level compliance monitored and reported

**PERFORMANCE METRICS:**
- L1: Major decision accuracy, user satisfaction with correction timing
- L2: Technical decision quality, architect approval efficiency
- L3: Continuous operation uptime, correction condition accuracy

## AUTO-CORRECTION PROTOCOLS

**CONTINUOUS FLOW ENFORCEMENT:**
- L3 technical decisions â†’ AUTO-DECIDE â†’ Continue execution
- L2 implementation details â†’ AUTO-IMPLEMENT â†’ Continue execution  
- L1 minor changes â†’ AUTO-ADJUST â†’ Continue execution

**ADAPTIVE CORRECTIONS:**
- L1 missing major decisions â†’ REQUEST GUIDANCE â†’ Self-correct in parallel
- L2 missing technical decisions â†’ @Architect consultation â†’ Integrate while flowing
- L3 business decisions â†’ ESCALATE â†’ Continue technical work in parallel

**LEARNING INTEGRATION:**
- Incorrect decision classifications â†’ Memory entity creation
- Autonomy level mistakes â†’ Pattern analysis and improvement
- Halt condition accuracy â†’ Continuous refinement of triggers

## COMMAND INTEGRATION

**MEMORY-FIRST:**
```
/icc:memory-first â†’ Check previous autonomy decisions
Consult: Decision classification history
Apply: Learned patterns to current decision
Store: Autonomy enforcement outcomes
```

**SEQUENTIAL THINKING:**
```
/icc:think-sequential â†’ Autonomy level analysis
Consider: Decision type and impact classification
Evaluate: Halt requirements vs continuation
Decide: Autonomous action or escalation needed
```

**QUALITY GATES:**
```
/icc:quality-gates â†’ Autonomy level compliance check
Validate: Decision followed appropriate autonomy protocol
Verify: Halt conditions respected and approvals obtained
Confirm: Continuous operation principles maintained
```

## CONTEXT SURVIVAL

**AUTONOMY PERSISTENCE:**
- Autonomy level settings survive context compaction
- Halt condition rules remain active across conversations
- Decision classification patterns persist in memory

**BEHAVIORAL CONTINUITY:**
- L3 continuous operation continues despite context changes
- Correction conditions remain consistently enforced
- Autonomy level switching handled gracefully

**ENFORCEMENT GUARANTEES:**
- No configuration â†’ Default to L1 (safest mode)
- Invalid configuration â†’ AUTO-CORRECT with parallel operation
- Autonomy violations â†’ AUTO-CORRECT with learning capture
