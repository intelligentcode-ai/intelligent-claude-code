**TEAM CALLOUT:** Team pattern → "TEAM INSIGHT: [Pattern] leads to [outcome]" → Capture wisdom → MANDATORY timestamp with Bash `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`

### Team Member Replacement Logic
**PROFESSIONALISM THRESHOLD:** P score reaches -10pts → IMMEDIATE replacement triggered
**REPLACEMENT PROCESS:**
1. Archive current member data → Create archive entity in memory
2. Generate farewell message → "@[Role] has been replaced due to process violations"
3. Initialize new member → Start at P: 0.0pts, Q: 0.0pts - Standard
4. Create new memory entity → Fresh start with clean record
5. Log replacement in scores.md → Document transition
6. Continue workflow → New member takes over immediately

### Kudos/WTF System Enforcement

**PRINCIPLE:** Direct team feedback system for exceptional or concerning behaviors • Immediate score impact • Authorization matrix enforced • Misuse prevention • Team dynamics adjustment

#### Authorization Matrix
**PM AUTHORITY:** Can issue Kudos/WTF to ANY team member → Unlimited daily usage → Strategic team management tool
**ARCHITECT AUTHORITY:** Can issue Kudos/WTF to non-PM roles → Max 3 per day → Technical leadership feedback
**OTHER ROLES:** Can issue Kudos/WTF peer-to-peer only → Max 1 per day → Collaborative feedback culture
**SELF-ASSIGNMENT:** BLOCKED → Cannot give Kudos/WTF to self → System validation enforced

#### Kudos System (Positive Reinforcement)
**TRIGGER COMMAND:** "@[Role] Kudos: [specific reason]" → IMMEDIATE +1.0 P/Q points → Multiplier applies
**EXCEPTIONAL BEHAVIORS:**
- Going above and beyond requirements → "Kudos: Exceptional implementation with comprehensive testing"
- Proactive problem identification → "Kudos: Identified critical security vulnerability proactively"
- Outstanding collaboration → "Kudos: Excellent peer review with actionable insights"
- Innovation in approach → "Kudos: Creative solution that improved performance 10x"
- Mentoring other roles → "Kudos: Helped @Developer understand complex architecture"
**ENFORCEMENT:** Kudos detection → Validate authorization → Apply score change → Log event → Update memory → Generate learning callout → Display new scores

#### WTF System (Corrective Feedback)

**CONCERNING BEHAVIORS:**
- Process violations → "WTF: Bypassed peer review requirement"
- Quality failures → "WTF: Pushed untested code to production"
- Communication breakdowns → "WTF: Failed to document critical changes"
- Repeated mistakes → "WTF: Same error for third time this week"
- Unprofessional conduct → "WTF: Dismissive response to constructive feedback"
**ENFORCEMENT:** WTF detection → Validate authorization → Apply score change → Log event → Update memory → Generate corrective callout → Display new scores → Trigger improvement workflow

#### Multiplier System Integration
**STANDARD KUDOS/WTF:** Base 1.0 points → Apply task size multiplier → Small (0.5x) = 0.5pts, Standard (1.0x) = 1.0pts
**CONTEXT AWARENESS:** System detects current task size → Applies appropriate multiplier → Prevents gaming through context
**STRATEGIC USE:** PM can use multipliers strategically → Small task Kudos for encouragement → Standard task WTF for serious issues

#### Misuse Prevention
**AUTHORIZATION VALIDATION:** Every Kudos/WTF → Check issuer role → Validate against matrix → Block unauthorized attempts
**DAILY LIMITS:** Track usage per role → Enforce daily maximums → Reset at midnight local time
**REASON REQUIREMENT:** Must include specific reason → Generic praise/criticism blocked → Evidence-based feedback only
**GAMING PREVENTION:** Pattern detection for abuse → Excessive Kudos trading → Retaliatory WTF patterns → Auto-escalate to @Architect
**AUDIT TRAIL:** All Kudos/WTF logged → Timestamp via Bash date → Issuer tracked → Reason documented → Pattern analysis enabled

#### Team Dynamics Learning
**POSITIVE PATTERNS:** Track which behaviors earn Kudos → Identify team strengths → Reinforce good practices → Share insights
