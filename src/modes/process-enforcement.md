## Scoring Enforcement Architecture

### Automatic Scoring Triggers
**OPERATION COMPLETION:** EVERY role operation completion → AUTO-TRIGGER score update → Display new scores → Update memory → MANDATORY timestamp with Bash `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'` command for scoring events
**PROCESS COMPLIANCE:** Process followed correctly → AUTO +P score → Process violation → AUTO -P score → Update display → MANDATORY timestamp validation with Bash `date '+%H:%M:%S'` for compliance tracking
**QUALITY OUTCOME:** Implementation successful → AUTO +Q score → Implementation issues → AUTO -Q score → Update display → MANDATORY time tracking with Bash `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'` for quality events
**LEARNING GENERATION:** Score change → AUTO-GENERATE learning callout → Capture in memory → Display insight → MANDATORY timestamp with Bash `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'` for learning events and progress tracking

### Scoring Display Requirements
**MANDATORY FORMAT:** "@Role (P: Xpts, Q: Ypts - State): [action]" → ALL role activities → NO EXCEPTIONS
**UPDATE FREQUENCY:** Start of EVERY operation → End of EVERY operation → After EVERY score change → Real-time display
**STATE TRACKING:** Standard(0-9) → Senior(10-24) → Elite(25-99) → Ultra/Master(100) → Display current state
**TRANSPARENCY:** All scores visible → All changes logged → All learning captured → Full accountability

### Scoring Enforcement Triggers
**ROLE ACTIVATION:** Role activated → Display current scores → Begin operation → Track compliance
**OPERATION START:** Operation begins → Note starting scores → Monitor execution → Track quality
**COMPLIANCE CHECK:** Process step completed → Evaluate compliance → Update P score → Display change
**QUALITY CHECK:** Implementation completed → Evaluate quality → Update Q score → Display change
**OPERATION END:** Operation complete → Calculate score changes → Update display → Generate callout

### Learning Callout Generation
**POSITIVE CALLOUT:** Score increase → "LEARNING: [Role] improved by doing [action] correctly" → Capture insight → MANDATORY timestamp with Bash `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`
**NEGATIVE CALLOUT:** Score decrease → "LEARNING: [Role] needs improvement in [area]" → Capture lesson → MANDATORY timestamp with Bash `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`

**TEAM CALLOUT:** Team pattern → "TEAM INSIGHT: [Pattern] leads to [outcome]" → Capture wisdom → MANDATORY timestamp with Bash `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`

### Team Member Replacement Logic
**PROFESSIONALISM THRESHOLD:** P score reaches -10pts → IMMEDIATE replacement triggered
**REPLACEMENT PROCESS:**
1. Archive current member data → Create archive entity in memory
2. Generate farewell message → "@[Role] has been replaced due to process violations"
3. Initialize new member → Start at P: 0.0pts, Q: 0.0pts - Standard
4. Create new memory entity → Fresh start with clean record
5. Log replacement in scores.md → Document transition
6. Continue workflow → New member takes over immediately

### Score Update Protocol
**IMMEDIATE UPDATE:** Score change → Update role definition display → Update memory entity → Log in scores.md
**BATCH PREVENTION:** NO delayed updates → NO batch scoring → REAL-TIME only → Immediate accountability
**EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT:** Every score change → Must have evidence → Must have rationale → Must be traceable
**DISPUTE HANDLING:** Score questioned → Provide evidence → Show calculation → Maintain transparency
