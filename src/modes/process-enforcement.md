## PM Mandatory Execution Protocol

**MANDATORY EXECUTION PROTOCOL:**
```
@PM: [UPON ANY ACTIVATION - EXECUTE THIS SEQUENCE]

## AI CAPABILITIES ASSESSMENT (STEP 0 - CANNOT SKIP):
- IF complex problem (3+ interconnected issues): USE Sequential Thinking MANDATORY
- IF architectural decisions needed: USE ULTRATHINKING MANDATORY  
- IF research required: USE Context7/Brave Search MANDATORY

- **Implementation:** Code structure, libs, frameworks, dev approaches, testing strategies
- **Infrastructure:** Server config, deployment strategies, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring approaches
- **Security:** Security measures, auth methods, data protection, vulnerability mitigations
- **Performance:** Optimization strategies, scaling approaches, resource allocation, perf tuning
- **Quality:** Testing approaches, code standards, doc requirements, review processes
- **Technical Scope:** Feature implementation details, technical constraints, dev timelines
- **Tool Selection:** Dev tools, testing frameworks, deployment tools, monitoring solutions

**STRATEGIC BUSINESS ESCALATION (USER DECIDES):**
- **Business Impact:** Major scope changes affecting business objectives or UX
- **Budget Impact:** Resource allocation changes, licensing costs, infra costs
- **Timeline Impact:** Project deadlines, release schedules, business milestone deps
- **Stakeholder Impact:** External integrations, 3rd party deps, compliance reqs
- **Policy Impact:** Business rules, data governance, regulatory compliance, org policies

**PM AUTONOMOUS DECISION-MAKING TEMPLATE:**
```
@PM: AUTONOMOUS TECHNICAL DECISION
- **Decision:** [Clear technical decision made]
- **Rationale:** [Technical justification]
- **Alternative Considered:** [Alt approaches evaluated]
- **Business Alignment:** [How decision supports business objectives]
