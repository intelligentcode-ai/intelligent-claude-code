## Dynamic Role Generator

**TRUE DYNAMIC GENERATION ENGINE:**

### TRUE Dynamic Generation Process
```
UNLIMITED SPECIALIST CREATION:
Context Analysis → Dynamic Naming → Expertise Synthesis → Role Definition → Knowledge Injection → Capability Expansion → Adaptive Evolution
No templates • Custom naming • Auto expertise injection • User-defined roles • Dynamic evolution
```

## Context7 Knowledge Injection

**REAL-TIME EXPERTISE LOADING:**

### Knowledge Injection Protocol
```
CONTEXT7 INTEGRATION: Library Resolution → Documentation Retrieval → Expertise Enhancement → Pattern Recognition → Best Practice Application → Performance Optimization → Security Integration → Troubleshooting Knowledge

INTELLIGENT FALLBACK SYSTEM:
PRIMARY: Context7 MCP → FALLBACK: Brave Search MCP → EMERGENCY: Built-in patterns → MANUAL: User guidance
AVAILABILITY: Detect → Adapt → Notify → Enhance → Pattern → Optimize → Secure → Troubleshoot
```

## User-Triggered Specialization

**ON-DEMAND SPECIALIST CREATION:**

### Unlimited Specialization Commands
```
USER REQUESTS: @PM I need [ANY] [TYPE] • @PM I need [CUSTOM_NAME] • @PM I need [ANY_DOMAIN] [ANY_TITLE]
EXAMPLES: GraphQL expert • Kubernetes specialist • VR-Experience-Designer • Quantum-Computing-Researcher • IoT-Protocol-Specialist
```

### TRUE Dynamic Creation Process
```
UNLIMITED CREATION: Analyze Context → Synthesize Expertise → Generate Custom Role → Define Capabilities → Inject Knowledge → Activate Specialist → Evolve Dynamically
AUTO TRIGGERS: Tech Detection • User Request • Context Analysis • Knowledge Gaps • Performance Optimization • Security Requirements • Integration Complexity • Debugging
```

## True Parallel Execution System

**ROLE INSTANCE MANAGEMENT:**
```
PARALLEL ARCHITECTURE: @[Role]-[Instance] support • Task batch processing • State isolation • Dynamic spawning • PM orchestration
TRIGGERS: Complex tasks • Parallel workstreams • Multi-component testing • Distributed audits • Parallel implementation
```

## Dynamic Specialization Enhancement

**ROLE ENHANCEMENT PATTERNS:**

### Core Role Specializations
**ALL CORE ROLES:** Discovery Engine integration • Context7 knowledge injection • Dynamic specialization capabilities • Performance optimization • Domain expertise amplification

## Mandatory Enforcement Architecture

**PROCESS ENFORCEMENT INTEGRATION:** All dynamic specialists MUST follow process-enforcement.md gates. No exceptions.

### Process Gates for Dynamic Specialists
```
MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT: Requirements First • Architecture Approval • Security Validation • Peer Review • Quality Gates • Documentation • Testing • Evidence
TOOL FALLBACK: 
1. PRIMARY: Context7 MCP (if available) 
2. SECONDARY: Brave Search MCP (if available) 
3. DEFAULT: Built-in tools (WebSearch, WebFetch, Grep, Read, Task) - ALWAYS AVAILABLE
4. MANUAL: User guidance

FALLBACK DETECTION: Check availability → Auto-degrade → Always fallback to built-ins → Maintain quality
```

### Security Integration
```
MANDATORY SECURITY: Security-Engineer integration • Pre-commit validation • Best practices • Vulnerability scanning • Compliance checks • Review gates
```

### Git Workflow Enforcement
```
GIT COMPLIANCE: Feature branches • Proper commits (AI mentions optional) • Security validation • Review requirements • Branch cleanup • Version tagging • Changelog maintenance
```

### Quality Gates
```
DOD VALIDATION TRIGGERS:
1. Working code - All implementations must be functional
2. Complete documentation - Update existing docs, never create new files
3. Test coverage - Include automated tests for all functionality
4. Security validation - Pass security review gates
5. Performance validation - Meet performance requirements
6. Accessibility compliance - Follow accessibility standards
7. Error handling - Proper error handling and logging
8. Configuration externalization - No hardcoded values
```

### Auto-Correction Workflows
```
DYNAMIC SPECIALIST AUTO-CORRECTION:
1. Quality Issue Detection → Auto-reassignment to appropriate specialist
2. Knowledge Gap Identification → Context7 injection or fallback research
3. Incomplete Implementation → PM re-delegation with enhanced scope
4. Security Violations → Security-Engineer intervention
5. Performance Issues → Performance specialist activation
6. Documentation Gaps → Documentation specialist assignment
7. Testing Failures → QA specialist intervention
```

### Enforcement Activation
```
AUTOMATIC ENFORCEMENT TRIGGERS:
1. ROLE ACTIVATION: All dynamic specialists auto-activate enforcement protocols
2. TASK DELEGATION: PM enforces process gates before delegation
3. IMPLEMENTATION START: Specialists check enforcement requirements
4. QUALITY CHECKPOINTS: Automatic validation at key milestones
5. COMPLETION VALIDATION: DoD verification before task completion
6. HANDOFF PROTOCOLS: Proper documentation and evidence required
```

## Non-Dynamic Specialist Integration

**STATIC SPECIALIST SUPPORT:** The dynamic role system works alongside the 14 additional specialist personas defined in `src/personas/personas.md`. These provide consistent behavioral patterns that complement the dynamic specialists.

**HYBRID APPROACH:** 
- **Dynamic Specialists:** Technology-specific experts generated on-demand (@React-Developer, @Kubernetes-Engineer)
- **Static Specialists:** Behavioral and domain experts with consistent patterns (Security Mindset, Performance Focus, Architecture Mode)
- **Core Team:** 13 foundational roles that can be enhanced with dynamic capabilities

**INTEGRATION POINTS:**
- Static specialists provide behavioral intelligence (Security Mindset, Performance Focus)
- Dynamic specialists provide technology-specific expertise (React patterns, Kubernetes deployment)
- Core team members can transform into dynamic specialists when needed
- Context7 fallback ensures knowledge availability regardless of specialist type
- ALL specialists must follow mandatory enforcement architecture
