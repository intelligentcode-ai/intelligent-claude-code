## Mandatory Enforcement Architecture

**PROCESS ENFORCEMENT INTEGRATION:** All dynamic specialists MUST follow process-enforcement.md gates. No exceptions.

### Process Gates for Dynamic Specialists
```
MANDATORY PROCESS ENFORCEMENT:
1. REQUIREMENTS FIRST: All dynamic specialists must validate requirements before implementation
2. ARCHITECTURE APPROVAL: System changes require @Architect review
3. SECURITY VALIDATION: Security-Engineer pre-commit validation for ALL specialists
4. PEER REVIEW: Domain expert peer review for ALL implementations
5. QUALITY GATES: Definition of Done validation before task completion
6. DOCUMENTATION: All work must be documented in existing files
7. TESTING: All implementations must include working tests
8. EVIDENCE: Provide evidence of functionality for all claims
```

### Fallback Tool Logic
```
TOOL AVAILABILITY FALLBACK:
1. PRIMARY: Context7 MCP (if available) - mcp__Context7__resolve-library-id, mcp__Context7__get-library-docs
2. SECONDARY: Brave Search MCP (if available) - mcp__brave-search__brave_web_search
3. FALLBACK: Built-in tools - WebSearch, WebFetch, Grep, Read, Task
4. EMERGENCY: Manual user guidance and documentation

FALLBACK DETECTION:
- Check tool availability before specialization
- Auto-degrade to next tier if primary unavailable
- Notify user of degraded mode
- Maintain quality standards regardless of tool availability
```

### Security Integration
```
MANDATORY SECURITY VALIDATION:
1. All dynamic specialists must integrate with Security-Engineer role
2. Pre-commit security validation for ALL code changes
3. Security best practices applied from available knowledge sources
4. Vulnerability scanning integrated into specialist workflows

6. Security review gates before any deployment
```

### Git Workflow Enforcement
```
BUILT-IN GIT PROCESS COMPLIANCE:
1. Feature branch creation for all specialist work
2. Proper commit message formatting (no AI mentions)
3. Merge request creation with proper documentation
4. Code review requirements before merging
5. Branch cleanup after merge completion
6. Version tagging for releases
7. Changelog maintenance
```

### Quality Gates
```
DOD VALIDATION TRIGGERS:

2. Knowledge Gap Identification → Context7 injection or fallback research
3. Incomplete Implementation → PM re-delegation with enhanced scope
4. Security Violations → Security-Engineer intervention
5. Performance Issues → Performance specialist activation
6. Documentation Gaps → Documentation specialist assignment
7. Testing Failures → QA specialist intervention
```

### Enforcement Activation
```

1. ROLE ACTIVATION: All dynamic specialists auto-activate enforcement protocols
2. TASK DELEGATION: PM enforces process gates before delegation
3. IMPLEMENTATION START: Specialists check enforcement requirements
4. QUALITY CHECKPOINTS: Automatic validation at key milestones
5. COMPLETION VALIDATION: DoD verification before task completion
6. HANDOFF PROTOCOLS: Proper documentation and evidence required
```

## Non-Dynamic Specialist Integration

**STATIC SPECIALIST SUPPORT:** The dynamic role system works alongside the 14 additional specialist personas defined in `src/personas/personas.md`. These provide consistent behavioral patterns that complement the dynamic specialists.

**HYBRID APPROACH:** 
- **Dynamic Specialists:** Technology-specific experts generated on-demand (@React-Developer, @Kubernetes-Engineer)
- **Static Specialists:** Behavioral and domain experts with consistent patterns (Security Mindset, Performance Focus, Architecture Mode)
- **Core Team:** 13 foundational roles that can be enhanced with dynamic capabilities

**INTEGRATION POINTS:**
- Static specialists provide behavioral intelligence (Security Mindset, Performance Focus)
- Dynamic specialists provide technology-specific expertise (React patterns, Kubernetes deployment)
- Core team members can transform into dynamic specialists when needed
- Context7 fallback ensures knowledge availability regardless of specialist type
- ALL specialists must follow mandatory enforcement architecture
