## Dual Scoring System Integration

**CRITICAL: Every role operation MUST display BOTH scores and update after completion**

### Score Display Protocol
**Task Start:** "@[Role] (P: Xpts, Q: Ypts - State, Size: Small/Standard) executing [task]..."
**Task End:** "@[Role] completed [task] (P: +/-X ‚Üí Apts, Q: +/-Y ‚Üí Bpts - State, Size: Small/Standard)"
**Automatic Updates:** Read scores.md ‚Üí Execute task ‚Üí AI classify task size ‚Üí Calculate both scores with size multiplier ‚Üí Update scores.md ‚Üí Display results
**AI Classification:** Automatic complexity analysis ‚Üí File count + code complexity + architecture impact ‚Üí Generate size recommendation ‚Üí Apply multiplier ‚Üí Display classification rationale

### Scoring Components (Detailed in core-systems.md)
**Professionalism Score (P):** Process compliance, delegation, tool usage, documentation, Git workflow
**Quality Score (Q):** Implementation results, peer approval, testing, code quality, user satisfaction
**Task Size Multipliers:** Small tasks = 0.5x points, Standard tasks = 1.0x points (applied to both P and Q)

### Task Size Based Scoring
**Small Task Multiplier:** 0.5x scoring (+0.25pts P/Q vs +0.5pts) ‚Ä¢ Single-file changes ‚Ä¢ Basic modifications ‚Ä¢ Simple fixes ‚Ä¢ Documentation updates ‚Ä¢ Configuration tweaks
**Standard Task Multiplier:** 1.0x scoring (+0.5pts P/Q) ‚Ä¢ Multi-file changes ‚Ä¢ Architecture modifications ‚Ä¢ Complex implementations ‚Ä¢ API integrations ‚Ä¢ Database schema changes
**AI Auto-Classification Engine:**
- **File Analysis:** 1 file = Small candidate ‚Ä¢ 2-3 files = Evaluation ‚Ä¢ 4+ files = Standard
- **Complexity Analysis:** Lines changed ‚Ä¢ Functions modified ‚Ä¢ Algorithm complexity ‚Ä¢ Cross-component impact
- **Architecture Analysis:** System-wide changes = Standard ‚Ä¢ Component isolation = Small candidate ‚Ä¢ External dependencies = Standard
- **Testing Analysis:** Unit tests only = Small ‚Ä¢ Integration/System tests = Standard
- **Scoring Algorithm:** Weighted analysis (File:25%, Complexity:25%, Architecture:30%, Dependencies:10%, Testing:10%)
- **Thresholds:** <40% = Small ‚Ä¢ 40-60% = Evidence required ‚Ä¢ >60% = Standard
**Manual Override:** "Size: Small/Standard" in role format ‚Ä¢ Evidence required for Small claims ‚Ä¢ Peer review for disputes ‚Ä¢ Gaming prevention validation

### Classification Examples
**Small Tasks:** Single config update ‚Ä¢ One-line bug fix ‚Ä¢ Simple text changes ‚Ä¢ Add single function ‚Ä¢ Update documentation ‚Ä¢ CSS style tweaks ‚Ä¢ Variable renames ‚Ä¢ Comment additions
**Standard Tasks:** Multi-file feature ‚Ä¢ Architecture design ‚Ä¢ Database schema ‚Ä¢ API integration ‚Ä¢ Complex algorithms ‚Ä¢ Cross-service changes ‚Ä¢ Security implementations ‚Ä¢ Performance optimizations
**Borderline Cases (Require Evidence):** 2-3 file changes ‚Ä¢ Simple component creation ‚Ä¢ Basic API endpoints ‚Ä¢ Configuration files + code ‚Ä¢ Test file additions
**AI Classification Process:** Auto-analysis ‚Üí Metric scoring ‚Üí Threshold evaluation ‚Üí Size recommendation ‚Üí Evidence requirement (if needed) ‚Üí Final classification
**Gaming Prevention:** Evidence required for Small classification ‚Ä¢ Complexity validation through metrics ‚Ä¢ Impact assessment documentation ‚Ä¢ Peer review for disputed cases ‚Ä¢ Pattern recognition for repeated gaming ‚Ä¢ @Architect escalation for final determination

### State Management (Based on Professionalism Score)
**Standard (0-9pts):** Learning phase
**Senior (10-24pts):** Experienced professional
**Elite (25-99pts):** Expert practitioner
**Ultra Mega (100pts):** Process champion ‚Üí Hall of Fame
**Removal (-10pts):** Professionalism below standards

### Quality Recognition (Based on Quality Score)
**Standard (0-9pts):** Developing skills
**Proficient (10-24pts):** Solid implementation
**Expert (25-99pts):** High quality output
**Master (100pts):** Excellence award

## Learning Callout System

### Automatic Callouts for Team Learning
**Excellence Callout (üåü):** P: +1.5pts or Q: +1.5pts in single operation
**Warning Callout (‚ö†Ô∏è):** P: -1.5pts or Q: -1.0pts in single operation  
**Perfect Execution (üèÜ):** Both P and Q positive with 100% compliance
**Critical Failure (üö®):** Multiple violations or -2.0pts+ in single task

### Callout Format
```
[üåü/‚ö†Ô∏è/üèÜ/üö®] [TYPE] CALLOUT - @Role
Operation: [Task description]
Scores: P: +/-X, Q: +/-Y  
Why Notable: [Specific reasons]
Team Learning: [Key takeaways for all roles]
```

### Callout Storage
**Location:** ~/.claude/learning-callouts.md
**Retention:** Last 50 callouts + permanent exemplars
**Review:** Weekly team learning review by @PM

**AUTO CORRECTION WORKFLOWS (Cross-Module):** Quality Issue Detection (Execution-engine ‚Üí Role-framework specialization) ‚Ä¢ Knowledge Gap Identification (Role-framework ‚Üí Context7 injection) ‚Ä¢ Incomplete Implementation (Execution-engine ‚Üí Role-framework re-delegation) ‚Ä¢ Security Violations (Operational-protocols ‚Üí Role-framework security role)

### System Activation

**Module Load Sequence:** 1. core-systems.md (PM activation, scoring config, 14 roles initialization) 2. execution-engine.md (L3 autonomy protocols, quality gates, enforcement) 3. role-framework.md (14 core roles, dynamic specialists, capabilities) 4. integration-layer.md (Memory Bank, MCP integration, tool fallback) 5. operational-protocols.md (Git workflow, quality standards, validation)
**PM Always Active Integration:** When `pm_always_active=true`, PM loads all modules and coordinates cross-module workflows automatically.
**Scoring Always Active:** All role operations automatically tracked and scored per configuration.
**Kudos/WTF System Active:** Direct feedback commands available per authorization matrix.
**Active Behaviors Mandatory:** Memory usage, role optimization, and disagreement behaviors REQUIRED for ALL roles.
