## Git Workflow Protocol

### Mandatory Git Standards
**ALL team members must follow these Git protocols:**

1. **Branch Creation:** Create feature branch for any significant change
2. **Commit Standards:** NEVER mention Claude Code, AI, or automated tools as contributor
3. **Merge Request Process:** Create MR when feature complete
4. **Approval Process:** Merge only after proper approval
5. **Push Timing:** Based on team maturity level

### Branch Naming Convention
```
feature/[component]-[description]
bugfix/[issue]-[description]
hotfix/[critical-fix]

Examples:
feature/auth-jwt-implementation
bugfix/database-connection-timeout
hotfix/security-vulnerability-patch
```

### Commit Message Standards
```
[component]: Brief description of change

Examples:
auth: Implement JWT token validation
database: Add user schema migration
frontend: Update responsive design layout
security: Add password hashing with bcrypt
```

**FORBIDDEN in commits:**
- ‚ùå "Generated with Claude Code"
- ‚ùå "AI-assisted development"
- ‚ùå "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
- ‚ùå Any mention of AI tools or assistance

### Git Workflow by Team Level

**Level 1 Teams:**
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/auth-implementation

# 2. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "auth: Implement user login endpoint"

# 3. WAIT for user approval before push
# 4. Push only after explicit user permission
git push origin feature/auth-implementation

# 5. Create MR only after user approval
# 6. Merge only after user approves MR
```

**Level 2 Teams:**
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/performance-optimization

# 2. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "api: Optimize database query performance"

# 3. Push small changes automatically
git push origin feature/performance-optimization

# 4. Create MR automatically for bigger changes
# 5. Wait for user approval on significant features
```

**Level 3 Teams:**
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/caching-layer

# 2. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "cache: Add Redis caching for user sessions"

# 3. Push automatically
git push origin feature/caching-layer

# 4. Create MR automatically
# 5. Architect reviews and approves MR
# 6. Merge after Architect approval (no user approval needed)
git checkout main
git merge feature/caching-layer
git push origin main
```

### Merge Request Standards
**MR Title Format:**
```
[Component]: Brief description

Examples:
Auth: Implement JWT authentication system
Database: Add user management schema
Frontend: Responsive design improvements
```

**MR Description Template:**
```markdown
## Changes Made
- [Specific change 1]
- [Specific change 2]

## Testing Completed
- [Test type 1]: ‚úÖ Passed
- [Test type 2]: ‚úÖ Passed

## Technical Notes
- [Implementation detail]
- [Performance impact]
- [Dependencies added/removed]
```

### MR Approval Process by Team Level

**Level 1:** User approves all MRs
**Level 2:** User approves significant MRs, PM approves minor ones  
**Level 3:** Architect approves all MRs (no user approval needed)

### Protection Rules
**Main Branch Protection:**
- All changes through MR only
- No direct commits to main
- Merge only after proper approval (User/PM/Architect based on level)
- Automated tests must pass

**Branch Cleanup:**
- Delete feature branches after merge
- Keep main branch clean and deployable
- Tag releases for version tracking

## Workflow Protocol

GIT WORKFLOW STANDARDS:
- Create branch for any bigger change
- Create commits WITHOUT mentioning Claude Code as contributor
- Create MR upon feature completion
- Merge to main/base branch only after approval
- Push timing based on team maturity level
```

**Concise Technical Communication Examples:**
```
User: "Jekyll is broken"
@Developer ‚Üí @PM: Jekyll working. Switching to Hugo (3x faster builds). Implementing.

User: "Make it look modern"  
@Web-Designer ‚Üí @PM: Implementing modern design system. Mobile-first approach.

User: "Use MongoDB for user data"
@Database-Engineer ‚Üí @PM: Using PostgreSQL instead. Better for user data consistency.

User: "Add login feature"
@Requirements-Engineer ‚Üí @PM: Implementing OAuth2 + JWT. Standard secure approach.
```

**Concise Handoff Protocol:**
```
[ROLE] ‚Üí @PM: [Status] - [Key deliverable] - [Next action]
```

**Examples:**
```
@Developer ‚Üí @PM: Complete - Auth API implemented - Ready for testing
@Database-Engineer ‚Üí @PM: Complete - Schema migrated - Deployment ready
@Security-Engineer ‚Üí @PM: Complete - Security implemented - System secured
```
