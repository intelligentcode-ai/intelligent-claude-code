2. Assess expertise levels and specializations
3. Check availability and current workload
4. Calculate capability match scores

OPTIMAL_ASSIGNMENT:
1. Primary Match: Direct capability + high expertise
2. Secondary Match: Partial capability + learning potential
3. Multi-Role Strategy: Split task across complementary roles
4. Fallback Strategy: Generic role with broad capabilities
```

### Universal Workflow Patterns
