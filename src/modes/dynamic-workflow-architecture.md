# Dynamic Workflow Architecture Module

## Capability-Based Routing System

**INTELLIGENT WORKFLOW ROUTING:** Route tasks by capabilities not role names • Dynamic assignment based on capability matching • Universal quality gates work with any role combination

### Core Capability Types
**CAPABILITY_ANALYSIS:** Requirements analysis • Stakeholder communication • Business analysis • Problem decomposition
**CAPABILITY_ARCHITECTURE:** System design • Technical leadership • Architectural decisions • Integration planning
**CAPABILITY_IMPLEMENTATION:** Code development • Feature implementation • Bug fixes • Integration work
**CAPABILITY_TESTING:** Quality assurance • Test strategy • Validation • Evidence collection
**CAPABILITY_SECURITY:** Security assessment • Threat modeling • Compliance • Vulnerability analysis
**CAPABILITY_DEPLOYMENT:** Infrastructure • CI/CD • Release management • Environment setup
**CAPABILITY_DESIGN:** UI/UX design • User experience • Visual design • Accessibility
**CAPABILITY_DOCUMENTATION:** Technical writing • Process documentation • Knowledge capture

### Intelligent Role Selection Algorithm

**MATCHING:** Analyze requirements→Map capabilities→Calculate scores→Assign optimal→Execute with fallback
**SCORING:** Direct Match +100 • Expertise +50/30/10 (Master/Expert/Intermediate) • Specialization +25 • Availability +10/5
**STRATEGIES:** Single (best match) • Multi (split capabilities) • Fallback (generic role)

### Universal Quality Gates

**WORKFLOW SEQUENCE:** CAPABILITY_ANALYSIS → CAPABILITY_ARCHITECTURE → CAPABILITY_IMPLEMENTATION → CAPABILITY_TESTING → CAPABILITY_SECURITY

**QUALITY GATE ENFORCEMENT:**
- Gate applies to ANY role combination
- Automatic role assignment based on capabilities
- Self-correcting when quality standards not met
- Progressive escalation through capability hierarchy

### Dynamic Specialist Integration

**INTEGRATION:** Auto-register specialists • Expand registry • Apply quality gates • Maintain compatibility
**EXPANSION:** Specialists add capabilities • Auto scoring/selection • Workflow integration • No disruption
**ADAPTATION:** Workflows adapt to capabilities • Intelligent degradation • Auto enhancement • Live updates

## Implementation Architecture

**BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY:** All existing @-notation preserved • Role definitions enhanced with capabilities • Quality gates maintained • Process enforcement integrated

**CROSS-MODULE INTEGRATION:** Works with all virtual team modules • Enhances core role functionality • Integrates with dynamic specialist generation • Supports Level 3 autonomous operations
