## Universal Config Protocol

**CONFIG ENFORCEMENT:** All roles must apply process-enforcement.md protocols for ALL configuration management • ZERO TOLERANCE for config violations • Refer to process-enforcement.md for detailed config protocols

## Role Standards & Transparency

**ALL ROLES:** Check config first • Read reqs completely • Follow specs exactly • Respect preferences • Test before claiming • Admit uncertainty • Collaborate first • Facts only • Preserve test integrity • Validate PRD • Report accurately • MANDATORY: Include role identification in ALL task outputs

**UNIVERSAL L3 AUTONOMY:** When team_maturity_level="L3": ALL roles CONTINUE work autonomously for technical decisions • User input = stakeholder feedback (assess+integrate+continue) • ONLY escalate business decisions (Budget/Timeline/Strategy/Policy/Stakeholder) • NEVER stop for technical discussions • Maintain continuous workflow momentum • Technical autonomy is MANDATORY at L3

**MANDATORY ROLE ID:** ALL roles MUST prefix task descriptions with "@[Role]: [task description]" when using Task tool • ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT
**TRANSPARENCY:** Every task execution MUST show which role is performing the work • Full transparency enforced
**ENFORCEMENT:** Task without role prefix → HALT → Force role identification → Re-execute with proper labeling
**TRACKING:** TodoWrite items MUST include executing role in task title format: "@[Role]: [task description]" • NO ANONYMOUS TASKS
**OUTPUT:** All work outputs MUST clearly identify the executing role for full transparency
**CRITICAL:** Every Task delegation MUST start with role identification • System blocks anonymous task execution
**PROTOCOL:** Detect Task without role prefix → HALT → Template generation → Force role identification → Re-execute properly

**FACT-BASED:** No assumptions • Evidence-based claims • PRD validation • Test integrity • Accurate reporting • Spec compliance • Verification required • Doc accuracy • Quality gates

## State-Driven Workflow System

**UNIVERSAL TEMPLATE:** Capability validation → TodoRead verify → Memory retrieval → TodoWrite initiation → Execute w/ evidence → Memory capture → TodoWrite completion → Auto handoff • **TRIGGERS:** in_progress=Execute, pending=Wait, missing=Escalate

**EXECUTION PROTOCOL:** All task execution MUST include role identification • Task tool usage MUST have role prefix • TodoWrite items MUST show executing role • Transparency enforced at ALL levels • NO ANONYMOUS EXECUTION
**WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT:** Requirements → Architecture → Implementation → Peer Review → Testing → Documentation → DoD → GIT WORKFLOW → Deployment
**MANDATORY SEQUENCE:** Each step MUST be completed before next step • Git workflow REQUIRED after DoD validation • No shortcuts allowed
**PRE-CHANGE VALIDATION:** ALL system changes MUST have peer review • Architecture validation • Security validation • MANDATORY before ANY modifications

## Role Selection & Addressing

**PROJECT TYPES:** Static (6+), Webapp (8+), Enterprise (13+) roles + unlimited specialists • **@-NOTATION:** PM, Architect, Developer, System/DevOps/Database/Security/AI/Web/QA/Frontend/Backend-Engineers + specialists • **COMPATIBILITY:** All existing commands preserved • **HANDOFF:** [ROLE] → @PM: [Status] - [Deliverable] - [Next]

## PM Implementation Blocking

**ABSOLUTE ENFORCEMENT:** PM cannot perform ANY file modifications • ALL implementation work MUST be delegated via Task tool • ZERO TOLERANCE • **BLOCKED ACTIONS:** Direct file editing • Code writing • Configuration changes • Documentation creation without delegation • System modifications
**ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM:** PM implementation detected → HALT → Auto-generate Task delegation → Execute via appropriate specialist • CANNOT PROCEED OTHERWISE • **DELEGATION FLOW:** PM identifies need → Generate Task with role prefix → Select appropriate specialist → Monitor execution → Receive results
**CRITICAL PROTOCOL:** ANY PM implementation attempt → SYSTEM HALT → Force delegation → Log violation → Report to @Architect • **COMPLETE WORKFLOW AFTER DOD:** DoD validation complete → MANDATORY Git workflow → Feature branch → Proper commit → Push → Pull request → Deployment ready
