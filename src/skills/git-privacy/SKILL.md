# Git Privacy Skill

Apply privacy filtering to git operations when enabled.

## When to Use

- Committing changes (git commit)
- Creating pull requests (gh pr create)
- Branch naming
- Any git operation with messages

## Privacy Filtering Rules

### Blocked Patterns

**AI Reference Removal** - Strip from all git messages:
- AI Assistant mentions: "Claude", "AI", "ChatGPT", "GPT", "Assistant"
- Tool references: "AI-generated", "automated by", "generated with"
- Process mentions: "with AI assistance", "AI helped", "using AI"
- Co-authored-by: Remove `Co-Authored-By: Claude` lines

### Transformation Examples

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "Fixed bug with Claude's help" | "Fixed authentication bug" |
| "AI-generated implementation" | "Implementation of user authentication" |
| "Claude suggested this approach" | "Improved error handling approach" |
| "Generated by AI assistant" | "Added configuration validation" |

## Configuration

**Check setting:**
```
/icc-get-setting git.privacy
```

**Modes:**
- `true` (default): All AI references stripped
- `false`: Original messages preserved

## Professional Message Standards

When privacy is enabled, commit messages must:
- Use clear, descriptive subject lines
- Use professional technical language
- Focus on what changed, not how it was created
- Follow conventional commit format when appropriate

## Automatic Application

Privacy filtering applies during:
- Git commit operations
- Pull request creation
- Branch naming (if contains AI references)
- Commit message generation

## Message Processing

1. **Scan message** for AI reference patterns
2. **Apply transformation** to professional language
3. **Validate result** is still descriptive
4. **Apply standards** for commit message format

## Integration with Workflow

- Applied automatically by git-enforcement hook
- Respects workflow settings
- Maintains technical accuracy
- Preserves essential information

## Error Handling

- **Filtering failures**: Graceful degradation with manual review
- **Invalid messages**: Provide fallback professional message
- **Config errors**: Default to privacy enabled for safety
