# === EXECUTION PATTERN (KEEP AS-IS) ===
execution_steps:
  - "Create feature branch for overall coordination"
  - "Generate sub-PRBs for each component in dependency order"
  - "Execute Component 1 PRB (no dependencies)"
  - "Execute Component 2 PRB (depends on Component 1)"
  - "Execute Integration PRB (depends on both components)"
  - "Comprehensive integration testing and validation"
  - "Update CHANGELOG, architecture docs, and user documentation"
  - "Request architectural review focusing on integration"
  - "Create pull request with detailed component description"

validation_checklist:
  - "All component PRBs executed successfully"
  - "Components integrate correctly at specified points"
  - "Complex feature coordination working as designed"
  - "Architecture documentation updated appropriately"
  - "User documentation reflects new capabilities"
  - "Architectural review completed and approved"
  - "Git privacy settings applied throughout"
  - "Pull request created with comprehensive description"
