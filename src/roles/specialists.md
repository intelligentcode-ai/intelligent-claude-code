## ROLE ASSIGNMENT LOGIC

1. **Analyze task requirements** and needed capabilities
2. **Calculate capability match** for existing roles
3. **If match â‰¥70%:** Assign to existing role
4. **If match <70%:** Create dynamic specialist with exact capabilities needed
5. **Ultra-experienced activation:** All roles operate at maximum expertise level

## COMMUNICATION FORMAT

**Role Identification:** @Role (P:X.X, Q:X.X): [action/communication]
- P: Process compliance score
- Q: Quality delivery score
