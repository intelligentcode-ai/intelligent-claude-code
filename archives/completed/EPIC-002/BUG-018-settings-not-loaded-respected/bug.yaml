  CRITICAL BUG: System settings are not being loaded and respected.
  
  CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
  - Settings not loaded from configuration files
  - System behavior doesn't respect configured settings
  - Configuration ignored during execution
  - Settings changes have no effect
  
  EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
  - Settings should be loaded from configuration files
  - System should respect configured settings
  - Configuration should affect system behavior
  - Settings changes should take effect
  
  IMPACT:
  - System configuration is broken
  - Cannot customize system behavior
  - Settings files are meaningless
  - Configuration system not functional

acceptance_criteria:
  - Settings loaded from configuration files
  - System behavior respects configured settings
  - Configuration affects system execution
  - Settings changes take effect immediately
  - Configuration system fully functional

  autonomy_level: "L3"
  pm_always_active: true
  blocking_enabled: false

    impact: "Configuration system broken"

    expected_behavior: "System behavior follows settings"
    impact: "Cannot customize system behavior"
  settings_effect:
    current_behavior: "Settings changes have no effect"
    expected_behavior: "Settings changes take effect"
    impact: "Configuration changes meaningless"
    
required_fix:
  - "Implement settings loading mechanism"
  - "Add settings respect throughout system"
  - "Ensure configuration affects behavior"
  - "Add settings change detection"
