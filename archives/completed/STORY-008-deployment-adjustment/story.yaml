problem_description: |
  The deployment system needs to be adjusted to use only the lean workflow
  system instead of the complex behavioral enforcement system. This is a
  major infrastructure change affecting how the system is deployed.
  
acceptance_criteria:
  - Deployment uses lean system only
  - Old behavioral modules not deployed
  - Virtual team imports updated
  - System boots with lean executor
  - No old enforcement patterns active
