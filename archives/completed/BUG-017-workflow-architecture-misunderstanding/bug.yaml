  CRITICAL BUG: Fundamental misunderstanding of workflow architecture.
  
  CURRENT WRONG APPROACH:
  - ONE git workflow for all changes (should be per inner workflow)
  - ONE review happening (should be per inner workflow)
  - Git workflows treated as outer-only (wrong level)
  - Reviews treated as outer-only (wrong level)
  - Learning processes missing from both levels
  
  CORRECT ARCHITECTURE:
  - INNER workflows: commits, pushes, reviews (per task)
  - OUTER workflows: branching, merging (per story/bug)
  - BOTH levels: learning processes and knowledge utilization
  
  IMPACT:
  - Workflow architecture is fundamentally broken
  - Git operations happening at wrong level
  - Reviews happening at wrong level
  - Learning processes missing
  - System doesn't follow proper workflow separation

acceptance_criteria:
  - Inner workflows handle commits, pushes, reviews per task
  - Outer workflows handle branching, merging per story/bug
  - Both inner and outer workflows include learning processes
  - Both levels ensure knowledge utilization
  - Proper workflow separation implemented
  - Git operations at correct levels
