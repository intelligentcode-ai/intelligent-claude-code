# Story Planning Session - OUTER WORKFLOW EXECUTION

**Triggered by:** @PM  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 09:55:00  
**Workflow:** outer-workflow-corrected.yaml  
**Scope:** P0 Priority Stories (Critical)

## Phase 1: Knowledge Retrieval

### Searching for Similar Work
- Query: "Priority system implementations"
- Query: "System bloat resolution"  
- Query: "Terminology migration projects"
- Query: "Virtual team architecture decisions"

### Knowledge Retrieved
- Previous priority implementations show P0→P1→P2→P3 pattern works
- System simplification projects: Remove complexity first, then rebuild
- Terminology fixes: Migration scripts + comprehensive updates needed
- Architecture decisions require specialist consultation

## Phase 2: Story Analysis

### P0 Stories Requiring Planning:

#### STORY-005: Implement Priority System
- **Who decides:** @Architect (system design) + @Requirements-Engineer (business rules)
- **Implementation:** @AI-Engineer
- **Dependencies:** None (foundational)

#### BUG-002: System Bloat
- **Who decides:** @AI-Architect (what to remove) + @DevOps-Engineer (deployment impact)
- **Implementation:** @AI-Engineer  
- **Dependencies:** Must be fixed before other stories can proceed

#### STORY-006: Terminology Migration
- **Who decides:** @AI-Architect (migration approach) + @Requirements-Engineer (validation)
- **Implementation:** @AI-Engineer + @System-Engineer
- **Dependencies:** After BUG-002 to avoid migrating bloated system

## Phase 3: Task Decomposition

### For Each P0 Story, I need to:
1. **Create tasks** that specialists can execute
2. **Assign specialists** based on expertise  
3. **Define dependencies** between tasks
4. **Set execution order** (blocking tasks first)

### Task Types Needed:
- Knowledge loading/research
- Architecture/design decisions  
- Implementation work
- Peer reviews
- Testing/validation
- Documentation updates
- Deployment/git operations
- Knowledge capture

## Phase 4: Specialist Assignment

**@AI-Architect:** Design decisions for all P0 items
**@AI-Engineer:** Implementation work  
**@DevOps-Engineer:** Deployment and system changes
**@Requirements-Engineer:** Requirements validation
**@System-Engineer:** Infrastructure impacts

## Phase 5: Execution Order (CRITICAL!)

**MUST execute in priority order - P0 first!**

1. **BUG-002** (System Bloat) - BLOCKING everything else
2. **STORY-005** (Priority System) - Foundational  
3. **STORY-006** (Terminology Migration) - Depends on #1 and #2

## Next Action Required

I need to trigger task planning for BUG-002 first, as it's blocking all other work.
