## [2.15.0] - 2025-07-05

### Added
- **CRITICAL PM Protocol Enforcement**: Mandatory blocking gates preventing process shortcuts
- **GATE 0: Requirements-Engineer Enforcement**: Mandatory for ALL requests - no bypassing allowed
- **GATE 1: Architect Enforcement**: Mandatory for system changes - prevents architectural shortcuts
- **GATE 2: Scope/Context Provision Enforcement**: Complete information required before role delegation
- **GATE 3: Peer Review Enforcement**: Domain expert peer review mandatory for all implementations
- **IMMEDIATE STOP enforcement**: Violations trigger immediate halt, no auto-correction
- **Complete scope/context provision**: All roles receive complete requirements and context
- **Domain expert peer review**: Automatic assignment of appropriate domain experts

### Changed
- **PM protocol**: Now includes 4 mandatory blocking gates with violation detection
- **Workflow sequence**: No conditional bypassing allowed - Requirements-Engineer mandatory for all
- **Role delegation**: Requires complete scope/context before any role assignment
- **Validation process**: Peer review enforcement with domain expert assignment

### Fixed
- **Process integrity**: Eliminated PM shortcuts and protocol violations
- **Requirements bypassing**: Mandatory Requirements-Engineer execution for all requests
- **Architect bypassing**: Mandatory Architect execution for system changes
- **Incomplete scope**: Mandatory complete information provision before delegation
- **Missing peer review**: Mandatory domain expert review before completion
