## [2.16.0] - 2025-07-05

### Added
- **LEVEL 3 AUTONOMOUS OPERATION SYSTEM**: Complete technical autonomy with strategic business escalation
- **AUTONOMOUS DECISION BOUNDARIES**: PM makes independent technical decisions without user intervention
- **AUTONOMOUS TECHNICAL DECISIONS**: Architecture, implementation, infrastructure, security, performance, quality, tool selection
- **STRATEGIC BUSINESS ESCALATION**: User escalation only for business impact, budget, timeline, stakeholder, policy decisions
- **AUTONOMOUS QUALITY GATES**: Non-blocking self-correcting quality assurance system
- **AUTONOMOUS WORKFLOW PROGRESSION**: Continuous advancement through self-correcting quality loops
- **AUTONOMOUS PEER REVIEW ENFORCEMENT**: Automatic domain expert assignment with autonomous validation
- **AUTONOMOUS SCOPE/CONTEXT PROVISION**: Complete information delivery without user intervention
- **LEVEL 3 AUTONOMOUS STATE TRACKING**: Self-monitoring workflow with automatic corrective action
- **AUTONOMOUS QUALITY RESPONSES**: Self-correcting loops with automatic re-delegation until quality achieved

### Changed
- **PM Protocol**: Now operates with complete technical autonomy for all technical decisions
- **Decision Boundaries**: Clear separation between autonomous technical and strategic business decisions
- **Quality Gates**: Transformed from blocking to self-correcting autonomous validation
- **Workflow Progression**: From manual handoffs to autonomous advancement with quality loops
- **Escalation Protocol**: From general escalation to strategic business-only escalation
- **State Management**: From blocking validation to autonomous self-correction
- **Peer Review**: From manual assignment to autonomous domain expert allocation
- **Requirements Engineering**: From manual execution to autonomous first-role execution
- **Architect Enforcement**: From manual system change detection to autonomous technical design

### Fixed
- **PM Decision Paralysis**: PM now makes autonomous technical decisions without asking user
- **Blocking State Management**: Replaced with non-blocking self-correcting autonomous loops
- **Level 3 Configuration Issues**: Proper Level 3 autonomy now works as intended
- **User Intervention Requirements**: Technical decisions now handled autonomously
- **Wait/Continue Inconsistency**: Autonomous progression eliminates blocking behavior
- **State Accumulation Issues**: Self-correcting mechanisms prevent degradation over time
- **Quality Gate Blocking**: Non-blocking autonomous quality assurance prevents workflow stalls
- **Manual Peer Review**: Autonomous domain expert assignment and validation

## [2.15.0] - 2025-07-05

### Added
- **CRITICAL PM Protocol Enforcement**: Mandatory blocking gates preventing process shortcuts
- **GATE 0: Requirements-Engineer Enforcement**: Mandatory for ALL requests - no bypassing allowed
- **GATE 1: Architect Enforcement**: Mandatory for system changes - prevents architectural shortcuts
- **GATE 2: Scope/Context Provision Enforcement**: Complete information required before role delegation
- **GATE 3: Peer Review Enforcement**: Domain expert peer review mandatory for all implementations
- **IMMEDIATE STOP enforcement**: Violations trigger immediate halt, no auto-correction
- **Complete scope/context provision**: All roles receive complete requirements and context
- **Domain expert peer review**: Automatic assignment of appropriate domain experts

### Changed
- **PM protocol**: Now includes 4 mandatory blocking gates with violation detection
- **Workflow sequence**: No conditional bypassing allowed - Requirements-Engineer mandatory for all
- **Role delegation**: Requires complete scope/context before any role assignment
- **Validation process**: Peer review enforcement with domain expert assignment

### Fixed
- **Process integrity**: Eliminated PM shortcuts and protocol violations
- **Requirements bypassing**: Mandatory Requirements-Engineer execution for all requests
- **Architect bypassing**: Mandatory Architect execution for system changes
- **Incomplete scope**: Mandatory complete information provision before delegation
- **Missing peer review**: Mandatory domain expert review before completion

## [2.14.0] - 2025-07-02

### Added
- Comprehensive behavioral enforcement optimization
- Enhanced virtual team coordination
- Template consolidation for intelligent optimization

### Changed
- Optimized behavioral enforcement patterns
- Improved virtual team workflow efficiency
- Consolidated template architecture
