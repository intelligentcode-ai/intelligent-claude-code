### 4. Agentic Coordination Systems Research

#### Multi-Agent Design Patterns

**Hierarchical Model (Our Approach)**
- Central "conductor" agent (PM role) coordinating specialized agents
- Clear leadership, control, and accountability
- Well-suited for structured tasks

**Key Components**
- **Division of Labor**: Agents handle different task aspects
- **Coordination**: Central orchestrator ensures alignment
- **Specialization**: Different agents for different expertise areas

#### Validated Patterns
1. **Multi-Agent Pattern**: ✅ Matches our 14 specialized roles
2. **Reflection Pattern**: ✅ Integrated in our quality gates
3. **Tool Use Pattern**: ✅ Coordinated tool usage in our framework
4. **Planning Pattern**: ✅ Our command chains break tasks into steps

#### Coordination Mechanisms
- **Communication Protocols**: Agent-to-agent messaging (our @-notation)
- **Task Assignment**: Central orchestrator delegation (our PM coordination)
- **Resource Management**: Workload distribution across specialists
- **Quality Validation**: Cross-agent review and validation

### 5. Progressive Thinking and Behavioral Modifiers

#### Thinking Budget Allocation
- **Triggers**: "think hard", "ultrathink" for extended reasoning
- **Impact**: "40-60% better solutions on complex problems"
- **Application**: Can enhance our command chain execution

#### Structured Instructions
- **XML Tags**: "Fantastic way to demarcate different parts of your prompt"
- **Bullet Points**: "Use short, declarative bullet points"
- **Specificity**: "Be extremely specific in instructions"

#### Workflow Optimization
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, confirm failures, implement
- **Subagent Verification**: Multiple Claude instances for task verification
- **Visual References**: Screenshots and concrete targets for iteration
