## Summary
Fixes compaction detection hook to restore complete behavioral context by loading virtual-team.md file content instead of showing nuclear warning messages.

## Changes
- **context-injection.js**: Added `loadVirtualTeamMd()` function with hierarchy search
- **Compaction Response**: Modified to output complete file content instead of warnings
- **Search Hierarchy**: Project dev context (`src/modes/virtual-team.md`) â†’ User global (`~/.claude/modes/virtual-team.md`)
- **Fallback**: Minimal warnings if virtual-team.md not found
- **VERSION**: 8.19.1 â†’ 8.19.2 (patch)
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Added v8.19.2 entry

## Problem
Previously, compaction detection showed nuclear warning messages telling the agent to run /icc-init-system, but didn't actually restore the behavioral patterns.

## Solution
Now directly loads and outputs the complete virtual-team.md content when compaction is detected, providing immediate behavioral context restoration without requiring manual initialization.

## Impact
Session continuations now receive complete behavioral framework automatically instead of just warnings.
