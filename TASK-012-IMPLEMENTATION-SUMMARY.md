# TASK-012 Implementation Summary

## Completed: Stage 1 (DEFINING) Commands

### Commands Created
1. **`/icc-create-epic`** - Creates new epics without stories/bugs/tasks
2. **`/icc-create-story`** - Creates new stories within epics without tasks
3. **`/icc-create-bug`** - Creates new bug reports within epics without tasks

### Key Features Implemented

#### ✅ PM-Only Validation
- All three commands validate that current role is @PM
- Clear error messaging if non-PM attempts to use

#### ✅ Project Scope Mandatory
- `--project-scope` is a required parameter for all commands
- Ensures business value/impact is always documented
- Addresses the CRITICAL REQUIREMENT from the story

#### ✅ No Task Creation
- Stage 1 (DEFINING) creates only the work item structure
- Tasks will be added in Stage 3 (REFINING) by Specialist Architect
- Clear separation of workflow stages

#### ✅ Proper ID Generation
- Epic: EPIC-XXX format
- Story: STORY-XXX format  
- Bug: BUG-XXX format
- Checks for ID uniqueness (when ID tracking implemented)

#### ✅ Directory Structure
- Epics: `epics/EPIC-XXX-title/`
- Stories: `epics/EPIC-XXX/stories/STORY-XXX-title/`
- Bugs: `epics/EPIC-XXX/bugs/BUG-XXX-title/`
- Automatic creation of subdirectories

#### ✅ Initial Status/Phase
- All items created with status: "PLANNED"
- All items created with phase: "DEFINING"
- Ready for Stage 2: PLANNING

### YAML Structure Highlights

#### Epic YAML
- Basic metadata (id, title, type, priority)
- Empty stories/bugs arrays
- Project scope included
- Goals and success criteria placeholder

#### Story YAML
- Links to parent epic
- Problem statement and user story placeholders
- Empty tasks array
- Embedded config inherited from epic
- Project scope included

#### Bug YAML  
- Links to parent epic
- Problem description and impact
- Root cause placeholder
- Priority/severity alignment
- Project scope included

### Next Steps
These commands are ready for:
1. Integration into workflow executor
2. ID tracking system integration
3. Stage 2: PLANNING with `/icc-plan-order`
4. Stage 3: REFINING with `/icc-plan-tasks`

### Testing Recommendations
1. Test PM role validation
2. Test project scope requirement
3. Test directory creation
4. Test epic updates when creating stories/bugs
5. Verify no tasks are created
