title: "Behaviors Don't Use Commands for Actions"
description: |
  Behaviors are supposed to use commands but instead have pseudo-functions.
  This breaks the integration between behavioral layer and command layer.
  
severity: HIGH
priority: P1
status: PLANNED
phase: PLAN

identified_issues:
  - "Behaviors use pseudo-functions not commands"
  - "No /icc command usage in behaviors"
  - "Integration layer missing"
  - "Architecture violation"

root_cause: |
  Behavioral system implemented without command integration.
  Commands and behaviors developed separately.

impact:
  - Behaviors cannot execute actions
  - System layers disconnected
  - Commands unused by system

acceptance_criteria:
  - Replace pseudo-functions with commands
  - Behaviors call /icc commands
  - Proper integration verified
  - Architecture compliance
