# BUG-114: Invalid Epic Assignments to Non-Existent EPIC-001

## Problem Description
Multiple bugs (BUG-110, BUG-111, BUG-112, BUG-113) incorrectly assigned to EPIC-001 which does not exist in the project.

## Current State
- EPIC-001: **DOES NOT EXIST**
- EPIC-002-workflow-enhancement: **EXISTS** (extensive structure)
- EPIC-011: **EXISTS** (minimal structure)

## Impact Assessment
- **Priority:** P0 (Critical - invalid data structure)
- **Impact:** High - corrupts work item hierarchy
- **Immediate Action:** Correct epic assignments

## Root Cause
Assumption of EPIC-001 existence without verification against actual project structure

## Required Corrections
- Update BUG-110, BUG-111, BUG-112, BUG-113 epic assignments
- Determine correct epic for each bug based on work domain
