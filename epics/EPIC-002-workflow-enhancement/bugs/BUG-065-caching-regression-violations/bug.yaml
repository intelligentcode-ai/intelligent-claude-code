problem_description: |
  CRITICAL REGRESSION: Multiple behavioral files contain caching logic that 
  violates the stateless execution model that was specifically fixed in BUG-062.
  This represents a fundamental violation of the core system architecture.
  
  Discovered violations:
  1. config-loader.md: Lines 19, 63 - Persistent cache class and TTL caching
  2. lean-workflow-executor.md: Line 35 - "Cache settings for session"
  3. role-activation-system.md: Line 266 - "Check cache first" for role states
  4. pm-command-system.md: Lines 157-162 - Clear caches functionality
  5. config-loader.md: Line 185 - CONTRADICTORY logic (says no caches but implements caching)
  
root_cause: |
  Incomplete implementation of BUG-062 stateless execution fixes:
  1. Caching logic was not fully removed from all behavioral files
  2. Some files contain contradictory stateless comments alongside caching code
  3. PM command system still references cache clearing operations
  4. Role activation system maintains persistent state caches
  5. Config loader has both caching AND stateless implementations
  
impact: |
  - Violates core stateless execution architecture
  - System behavior inconsistent with BUG-062 fixes
  - Potential runtime errors when caches assumed to exist
  - PM commands reference non-existent cache clearing
  - Configuration loading contradicts its own stateless model
  - Architectural integrity compromised
