# BUG-117: System Redundancy - Remove Duplicate Functionality

## Problem Description
The executable-workflow.md now defines 75%+ of system behavior, making many behaviors and commands redundant:
- Multiple behaviors duplicate workflow steps
- Commands exist for things the workflow handles
- Shared patterns replicate workflow logic
- System is bloated with overlapping functionality

## Impact
- Maintenance nightmare with duplicated logic
- Confusion about which component handles what
- Larger codebase than necessary
- Harder to understand system flow

## Requirements
- CAREFULLY analyze EACH file against workflow
- REMOVE redundancies
- KEEP all functionality
- Workflow should be at the CENTER
- NO assumptions about reduction percentage

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Each behavior justified against workflow
- [ ] Each command necessary beyond workflow
- [ ] Shared patterns consolidated
- [ ] Zero functionality lost
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
