# BUG-111: Incorrect PM+Architect Triage Timing in Workflow

## Problem Description
PM+Specialist Architect triage is incorrectly triggered during bug/story creation instead of after work item completion.

## Current Incorrect Behavior
- Triage occurs immediately when bug/story is created
- Disrupts ongoing work with premature planning
- Violates outer workflow sequence

## Expected Correct Behavior
- Triage occurs AFTER completing current work item
- Based on priority, impact, effort, and complexity analysis
- Selects NEXT work item for execution

## Impact Assessment
- **Priority:** P0 (Critical workflow violation)
- **Impact:** High - disrupts work flow and violates core patterns
- **Complexity:** Medium - requires workflow pattern correction

## Root Cause
Misunderstanding of outer workflow timing and triggers
