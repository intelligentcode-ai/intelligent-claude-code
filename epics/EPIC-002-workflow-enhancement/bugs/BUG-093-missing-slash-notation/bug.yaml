title: "Commands Rarely Reference Other Commands - Missing Slash Notation"
description: |
  Command-calls in commands are VERY RARE and when used, don't use slash notation.
  Using 'icc-plan-tasks' instead of '/icc-plan-tasks'.
  Commands should reference other commands properly for workflow integration.
  
severity: HIGH
priority: P1
status: PLANNED
phase: PLAN

identified_issues:
  - "Very rare command-to-command references"
  - "Missing slash notation when referencing commands"
  - "Poor workflow integration between commands"
  - "Inconsistent command reference format"

root_cause: |
  Commands written in isolation without considering command chains.
  Missing standards for command-to-command references.
  No enforcement of slash notation format.

impact:
  - Poor command workflow integration
  - Inconsistent user experience
  - Missed automation opportunities
  - Fragmented command chains

acceptance_criteria:
  - Increase command-to-command references where appropriate
  - Use proper slash notation (/icc-command-name)
  - Create command chain patterns
  - Improve workflow integration
