  CRITICAL BUG: Role collaboration mechanisms are not implemented in the system.
  Roles operate in isolation without proper coordination, handoff, or collaborative
  patterns as described in the virtual team specifications.
  
  Observed violations:
  1. No role handoff mechanisms between specialists
  2. No collaborative task execution patterns
  3. Roles don't coordinate or share context
  4. No multi-role task assignment capabilities
  5. PM role not properly delegating to specialists
  6. No role state sharing or context preservation
  
  This violates the virtual team architecture where roles should collaborate
  seamlessly with proper handoffs, shared context, and coordinated execution.
  
root_cause: |
  Role collaboration architecture not implemented:
  1. No role handoff protocols in behavioral modules
  2. No shared context mechanisms between roles
  3. No collaborative task execution patterns
  4. No multi-role coordination workflows
  5. Role activation system doesn't support collaboration
  6. No role state sharing mechanisms
  
impact: |
  - Roles operate in isolation without coordination
  - No collaborative task execution
  - PM role cannot properly delegate
  - No role handoffs or context sharing
  - Virtual team benefits not realized
  - Work items executed by single roles instead of team
