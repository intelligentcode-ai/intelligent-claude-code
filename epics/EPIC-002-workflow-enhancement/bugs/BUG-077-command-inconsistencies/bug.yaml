title: "Command Size and Format Inconsistencies"
description: |
  Multiple command inconsistencies identified:
  - icc-plan-bug is much larger than icc-plan-story (why?)
  - icc-load still contains pseudo-code
  - Instruction format wildly different across commands
  - icc-archive-completed is bloated
  
severity: MEDIUM
priority: P2
status: PLANNED
phase: PLAN

identified_issues:
  - "icc-plan-bug larger than icc-plan-story"
  - "icc-load contains pseudo-code"
  - "Inconsistent instruction formats"
  - "icc-archive-completed bloated"

root_cause: |
  No standardization or review of command implementations.
  Commands evolved independently without consistency checks.

impact:
  - Confusing for users
  - Maintenance difficulty
  - Inconsistent behavior

acceptance_criteria:
  - Research and choose BEST instruction format
  - Standardize all commands
  - Remove pseudo-code from icc-load
  - Optimize bloated commands
