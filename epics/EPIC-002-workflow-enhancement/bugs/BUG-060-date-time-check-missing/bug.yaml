  title: "System fails to check current date/time before using dates"
  type: "behavioral_violation"
  epic: "EPIC-002"

problem_description: |
  The system uses hardcoded dates without checking actual current date/time,
  leading to incorrect timestamps in learning entities and file names.
  
  Example: Created entities with "2025-01-17" when actual date was "2025-07-17"
  
root_cause: |
  No behavioral pattern enforcing date/time check before date usage.
  Developers assume dates rather than retrieving them.
  
impact: |
  - Wrong dates in memory entities (6 months off!)
  - Incorrect file naming with dates
  - Historical data corruption
  - Learning timeline confusion
