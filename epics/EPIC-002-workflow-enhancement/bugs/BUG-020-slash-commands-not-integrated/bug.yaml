problem_description: |
  STORY-008 created 8 icc: slash commands but they are NOT integrated into
  the actual workflow execution system. The commands exist in .claude/commands/
  but the behavioral modules (lean-workflow-executor.md, virtual-team.md) do
  not reference or use these commands. This means the commands are orphaned
  and not "executed and involved more reliably" as originally requested.
  
root_cause: |
  Incomplete implementation - focused on creating command files without
  integrating them into the execution flow of the system.
  
impact: |
  - Commands exist but aren't used by the system
  - User's goal of "more reliable execution" not achieved
  - Workflow continues using behavioral patterns instead of slash commands
