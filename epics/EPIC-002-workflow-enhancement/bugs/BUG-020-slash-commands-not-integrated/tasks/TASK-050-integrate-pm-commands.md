# TASK-050: Integrate PM Commands with icc Commands

**ID:** TASK-050  
**Bug:** BUG-020  
**Title:** Integrate PM commands to delegate to icc commands  
**Type:** integration  
**Assigned:** @Developer  
**Status:** planned  
**Priority:** P0  

## Problem Description
PM commands (@PM init, @PM reset, @PM refresh) exist separately from icc commands. They should delegate to the appropriate icc commands for consistency.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] @PM init delegates to /icc-init-system
- [ ] @PM reset uses proper icc command sequence
- [ ] @PM refresh delegates to /icc-system-status
- [ ] All PM commands integrate with icc command system

## Implementation Steps
1. Update PM command handlers to call icc commands
2. Ensure proper delegation and response handling
3. Maintain PM command interface while using icc backend
4. Test integration works properly

## Dependencies
- TASK-023 (Workflow executor integration)

## Estimated Effort
2 hours

## Status
Planned - Integrate PM and icc commands
