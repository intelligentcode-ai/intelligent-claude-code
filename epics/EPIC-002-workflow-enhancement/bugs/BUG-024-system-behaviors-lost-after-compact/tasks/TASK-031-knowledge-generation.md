# TASK-031: Knowledge Generation

**ID:** TASK-031  
**Bug:** BUG-024  
**Title:** Generate knowledge from solution  
**Type:** knowledge_creation  
**Assigned:** @AI-Engineer  
**Status:** completed  
**Priority:** P0  

## Problem Description
Capture learnings and patterns from the behavioral persistence solution for future reference.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Solution patterns documented
- [x] Recovery procedures captured
- [x] Memory entities created
- [x] Team knowledge shared

## Implementation Steps
1. ✅ Document persistence patterns - Comprehensive solution architecture documented
2. ✅ Create recovery playbook - Complete operational procedures created
3. ✅ Store in memory system - 7 knowledge entities with relationships created
4. ✅ Share with team - Knowledge base document created for team access

## Dependencies
- TASK-030 (Test context recovery) - COMPLETED

## Estimated Hours
2 hours (actual: 1.5 hours)

## Status
