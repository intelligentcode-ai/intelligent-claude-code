# TASK-029: Peer Review

**ID:** TASK-029  
**Bug:** BUG-024  
**Title:** Peer review persistence implementation  
**Type:** review  
**Assigned:** @AI-Architect  
**Status:** completed  
**Priority:** P0  

## Problem Description
Review the behavioral persistence mechanism and recovery commands for architectural compliance and completeness.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Architecture validated
- [x] Implementation reviewed
- [x] Recovery tested
- [x] Feedback incorporated

## Implementation Steps
1. ✅ Review persistence architecture - State preservation design approved
2. ✅ Validate implementation approach - Command structure and integration validated
3. ✅ Test recovery mechanisms - Error handling and command flow tested
4. ✅ Provide feedback and approval - Minor state file update applied, APPROVED

## Dependencies
- TASK-028 (Create recovery commands) - COMPLETED

## Estimated Hours
2 hours (actual: 1.5 hours)

## Status
**COMPLETED** - Peer review completed with APPROVAL

## Review Details
**ARCHITECTURAL APPROVAL: ✅ APPROVED**

**Validated Components:**
- State preservation architecture (JSON serialization approach)
- Recovery command design (two-command separation)
- Integration strategy (non-breaking enhancement)
- Error handling mechanisms (graceful fallbacks)
- Security compliance (no credential exposure)
- Workflow compliance (proper process adherence)

**Minor Fix Applied:**
- Updated .claude/system-state.json to include new recovery commands

**Recommendations for Future:**
- Consider versioned state files for backward compatibility
- Add recovery success metrics
- Include automated recovery tests
- Develop troubleshooting documentation

**Final Verdict:** Implementation successfully resolves BUG-024 root cause with comprehensive state preservation and reliable recovery mechanisms.
