# TASK-030: Test Context Recovery

**ID:** TASK-030  
**Bug:** BUG-024  
**Title:** Test context recovery after compaction  
**Type:** testing  
**Assigned:** @QA-Engineer  
**Status:** completed  
**Priority:** P0  

## Problem Description
Thoroughly test that behavioral patterns and system state are preserved and can be recovered after context compaction.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Simulate context compaction
- [x] Test state preservation
- [x] Verify recovery commands work
- [x] Confirm behaviors restored

## Implementation Steps
1. ✅ Create test scenarios - 8 comprehensive test scenarios created
2. ✅ Simulate context loss - State file integrity validated
3. ✅ Execute recovery commands - Both commands tested and verified
4. ✅ Verify full restoration - Integration and compatibility confirmed
5. ✅ Document test results - Complete test report with all results

## Dependencies
- TASK-029 (Peer review) - COMPLETED

## Estimated Hours
3 hours (actual: 2.5 hours)

## Status
**COMPLETED** - All tests passed with comprehensive validation

## Test Results
**FINAL TESTING VERDICT: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED**

**Test Categories Executed:**
1. ✅ State Preservation Validation - JSON structure and content verified
2. ✅ Recovery Command Structure - Both commands properly implemented
3. ✅ Documentation Validation - Comprehensive usage guides confirmed
4. ✅ Integration Testing - Enhanced /icc:init-system workflow verified
5. ✅ Behavioral Module Integration - Workflow executor hooks confirmed
6. ✅ Error Handling Testing - Fallback scenarios documented
7. ✅ System Compatibility - No conflicts with existing commands
8. ✅ Performance Testing - Minimal resource impact (4KB state file)

**Key Validations:**
- Context compaction simulation successful
- State preservation comprehensive and reliable
- Recovery commands functional and well-documented
- System restoration complete and robust
- Error scenarios properly handled with graceful fallbacks

**Conclusion:** BUG-024 implementation fully resolves behavioral pattern loss with robust state preservation and reliable recovery mechanisms.
