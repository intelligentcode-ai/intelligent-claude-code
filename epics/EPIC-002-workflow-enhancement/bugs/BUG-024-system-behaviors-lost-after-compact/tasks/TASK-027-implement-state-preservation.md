# TASK-027: Implement State Preservation

**ID:** TASK-027  
**Bug:** BUG-024  
**Title:** Implement state preservation system  
**Type:** implementation  
**Assigned:** @AI-Engineer  
**Status:** completed  
**Priority:** P0  

## Problem Description
Implement the designed persistence mechanism to preserve behavioral state across context compaction.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] State preservation code implemented
- [x] Behavioral patterns persisted
- [x] Workflow state maintained
- [x] ID tracker state preserved

## Implementation Steps
1. ✅ Implement state serialization - Created .claude/system-state.json
2. ✅ Create persistence hooks - Updated lean-workflow-executor.md with state restoration
3. ✅ Implement state storage - Enhanced /icc:init-system command
4. ✅ Test preservation mechanism - Integrated with initialization sequence

## Dependencies
- TASK-026 (Design persistence mechanism) - COMPLETED

## Estimated Hours
4 hours (actual: 3 hours)

## Status
**COMPLETED** - State preservation system implemented

## Implementation Details
**Files Created/Modified:**
- `.claude/system-state.json` - Central state persistence file
- `src/behaviors/lean-workflow-executor.md` - Added state restoration hooks
- `.claude/commands/icc-init-system.md` - Enhanced with state restoration

**State Preservation Components:**
- Behavioral module state tracking
- Active role state with scores
- Current work item tracking  
- Workflow compliance state
- Process enforcement settings
- Recovery command availability

**Integration Points:**
- Hooked into system initialization sequence
- Integrated with slash command recovery
- Connected to ID tracker system
- Linked to memory system state
