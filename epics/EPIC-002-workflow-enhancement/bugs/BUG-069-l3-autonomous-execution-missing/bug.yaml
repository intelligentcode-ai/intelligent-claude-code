  CRITICAL BUG: L3 autonomous execution is not implemented despite L3 config
  settings being present in embedded configs. The system should execute
  continuously without stopping for approvals, but it's still exhibiting
  L1/L2 behavior patterns.
  
  Observed violations:
  1. System stopping for approvals despite L3 config
  2. Roles asking for confirmation instead of executing autonomously
  3. Workflow execution not continuous as expected in L3 mode
  4. No implementation of L3 continuous execution engine
  5. Autonomy level not properly applied during execution
  6. L3 behavioral patterns not enforced
  
  This violates the L3 autonomous execution model where the system should
  execute continuously with minimal stops only for critical conditions.
  
root_cause: |
  L3 autonomous execution not implemented:
  1. L3 continuous execution engine not integrated
  2. Autonomy level not properly applied during workflow execution
  3. L3 behavioral patterns not enforced
  4. No continuous execution loops
  5. Stop conditions not properly defined for L3
  6. Task queue management not implemented for L3
  
impact: |
  - L3 autonomous execution benefits not realized
  - System stops for approvals despite L3 config
  - Workflow execution not continuous
  - Team productivity reduced
  - L3 configuration ignored
  - Autonomous execution model not functional
