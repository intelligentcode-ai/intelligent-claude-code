# TASK-001 Learning Architecture Design

**Task:** Design active learning system restoration  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Architect  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Priority:** blocking  
**Dependencies:** none

## Architecture Requirements

### Error Forgiveness System
- First error of each type forgiven (learning opportunity)
- Second error of same type penalized (learning ignored)
- Error type tracking and pattern detection
- Memory integration for error history

### Learning Bonus System
- +0.5P/Q for applying previous learning
- Detection of learning application patterns
- Bonus calculation and application
- Learning reference validation

### Pattern Capture Mechanism
- Learning entity creation (Learning-[ErrorType]-[YYYY-MM-DD])
- Pattern extraction from errors and successes
- Knowledge storage in memory system
- Cross-role learning sharing

### Learning Application
- Pattern recognition in new tasks
- Previous learning consultation
- Learning-based decision making
- Continuous improvement tracking

## Implementation Design

### Learning Detection Engine
```pseudocode
FUNCTION detectLearningOpportunity(error):
    previousLearning = searchMemory("Learning-" + error.type)
    IF previousLearning.exists:
        applyPenalty(error.role, -2.0)  // Second error
    ELSE:
        createLearningEntity(error)      // First error
        NO_PENALTY
```

### Learning Bonus Engine
```pseudocode
FUNCTION detectLearningApplication(action):
    IF action.references_previous_learning:
        applyBonus(action.role, +0.5)
```

## Integration Points

- Memory system for learning storage
- Scoring system for bonuses/penalties
- Workflow execution for detection
- Role management for application
