  CRITICAL BUG: Active learning system is missing from the current system.
  
  MISSING FUNCTIONALITY:
  - Error forgiveness system (first error forgiven, second penalized)
  - Learning pattern capture missing
  - Active learning bonuses missing (+0.5P/Q for applying previous learning)
  - Learning entity creation not working
  - Pattern application not functional
  
  CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
  - No error forgiveness system
  - No learning pattern capture
  - No learning bonuses applied
  - No learning entity creation
  - No pattern application
  
  EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
  - First error of each type should be forgiven (learning opportunity)
  - Second error of same type should be penalized (learning ignored)
  - Learning bonuses should be applied (+0.5P/Q for applying previous learning)
  - Learning entities should be created and stored
  - Pattern application should work
  
  IMPACT:
  - No learning from errors
  - No continuous improvement
  - No pattern recognition
  - System doesn't get better over time
  - Learning culture is broken

acceptance_criteria:
  - Error forgiveness system functional (first error forgiven, second penalized)
  - Learning pattern capture working
  - Learning bonuses applied (+0.5P/Q for applying previous learning)
  - Learning entity creation working
  - Pattern application functional
  - Active learning system fully operational
