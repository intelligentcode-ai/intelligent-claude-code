  title: "System uses time estimates instead of effort estimates"
  type: "process_violation"
  epic: "EPIC-002"
  created: "2025-07-17 17:30:00"

problem_description: |
  The system is using time-based estimates (hours) instead of effort-based
  estimates (story points/complexity). This violates agile best practices
  and creates unrealistic expectations. Found 34 files with "estimated_hours"
  that need migration to effort-based estimation.
  
root_cause: |
  Templates were created with time-based estimation. This has propagated
  throughout all stories, bugs, and tasks in the system.
  
impact: |
  - Creates false precision in estimates
  - Focuses on time instead of complexity
  - Violates agile estimation principles
  - Inconsistent with industry best practices
