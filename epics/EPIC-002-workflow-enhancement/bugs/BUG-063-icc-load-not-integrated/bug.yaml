  epic: "EPIC-002"

  phase: "EXECUTE"
  
problem_description: |
  The /icc-load command exists in src/commands/icc-load.md but is NOT integrated
  into the lean-workflow-executor.md behavioral module. This critical command
  for force-loading behavioral patterns is completely missing from:
  - System initialization sequence
  - Slash command processing
  - Workflow execution flow
  
  This means the command cannot be executed and behavioral patterns cannot be
  force-loaded as intended by the system design.
  
root_cause: |
  Incomplete integration during command creation. The command file was created
  but the integration step into behavioral modules was skipped, leaving the
  command orphaned and non-functional.
  
impact: |
  - System cannot force-load behavioral patterns
  - /icc-load command is non-functional
  - Behavioral pattern loading is incomplete
  - System initialization missing critical step
