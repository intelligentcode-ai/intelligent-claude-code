title: "Behaviors Don't Use Commands - Token Waste and Duplication"
description: |
  Behavioral files contain duplicate content instead of referencing commands.
  This causes massive token waste and content duplication.
  Behaviors should reference commands wherever possible instead of duplicating logic.
  
severity: CRITICAL
priority: P0
status: PLANNED
phase: PLAN

identified_issues:
  - "Behaviors duplicate command content"
  - "No command references in behaviors"
  - "Massive token waste"
  - "Content duplication across files"
  - "Maintenance nightmare"

root_cause: |
  Behaviors written without considering existing commands.
  No pattern for referencing commands from behaviors.
  Duplicate content easier than proper references.

impact:
  - Excessive token usage
  - Content becomes out of sync
  - Maintenance complexity increases
  - User confusion from duplicates
  - System becomes bloated

acceptance_criteria:
  - Update behaviors to reference commands
  - Remove duplicate content
  - Create command reference patterns
  - Reduce token usage significantly
  - Maintain single source of truth
