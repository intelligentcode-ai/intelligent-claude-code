problem_description: |
  CRITICAL BEHAVIORAL FAILURE: The validation chain is repeatedly bypassed
  causing multiple system failures:
  
  1. Role assignments without Specialist Architect consultation
  2. Bug/story creation without proper triage
  3. Git operations without settings enforcement
  4. Self-assignment violations
  5. L3 autonomy used as excuse to bypass validation
  
  The system needs SELF-CORRECTING validation that automatically performs
  missing validation steps without stopping L3 autonomous execution.
  
root_cause: |
  Validation chains are documented as GUIDANCE but not implemented as
  MANDATORY AUTO-CORRECTION. The behavioral system lacks enforcement
  mechanisms that automatically detect and correct validation violations.
  
impact: |
  - Repeated validation chain bypasses
  - Wrong role assignments causing poor quality
  - Git operations violate user privacy settings
  - System unreliable due to process violations
  - Trust in behavioral system is broken
  - L3 autonomy produces poor results
