# TASK-003: [AI-Engineer] Refine Workflow Integration

## Overview
**Task ID:** TASK-003
**Title:** [AI-Engineer] Refine Workflow Integration
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Assigned To:** @AI-Engineer
**Priority:** P0 (critical_path)
**Type:** implementation

## Description
Enhance icc-plan-tasks command to explicitly reference workflow templates and ensure perfect alignment.

## Subtasks
1. **Add workflow template references**
   - Import workflow phase definitions
   - Add comments linking to phases
   - Document phase mapping

2. **Enhance task descriptions**
   - Add workflow phase to each task
   - Include phase requirements
   - Reference validation gates

3. **Strengthen ordering enforcement**
   - Add validation for task sequence
   - Prevent out-of-order tasks
   - Enforce phase prerequisites

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Workflow templates explicitly referenced
- [ ] Task-to-phase mapping clear
- [ ] Ordering enforcement strengthened
- [ ] Command fully workflow-aware

## Dependencies
- TASK-002 (need analysis results)

## Output
- Enhanced command implementation
- Clear workflow integration
- Stronger ordering guarantees
