# TASK-002: [AI-Engineer] Analyze Current Implementation

## Overview
**Task ID:** TASK-002
**Title:** [AI-Engineer] Analyze Current Implementation
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Assigned To:** @AI-Engineer
**Priority:** P0 (critical_path)
**Type:** research

## Description
Analyze the current icc-plan-tasks command implementation to verify workflow-based ordering.

## Subtasks
1. **Review command implementation**
   - Check standardized numbering system
   - Verify task categories (001-009, 010-994, 995-999)
   - Confirm workflow alignment

2. **Compare with workflow phases**
   - Map task numbers to workflow phases
   - Verify knowledge retrieval first
   - Confirm wrap-up tasks last

3. **Identify any gaps**
   - Check if implementation matches bug report
   - Find any missing workflow integration
   - Document refinements needed

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Current implementation analyzed
- [x] Workflow alignment verified
- [x] Gaps or refinements identified
- [x] Ready for enhancement

## Dependencies
- TASK-001 (need workflow knowledge)

## Output
- Implementation analysis report
- Workflow alignment matrix
- Enhancement recommendations

## Completed Analysis

### Key Findings
1. **The icc-plan-tasks command ALREADY implements workflow-aware task ordering**
2. **The bug description is partially inaccurate** - tasks ARE organized by workflow phases
3. **The numbering system (001-009, 010-994, 995-999) maps to workflow phases**

### Current Workflow Alignment
- **001-009**: Process tasks → knowledge_retrieval & task_planning phases ✅
- **010-994**: Core work → task_execution, validation, peer_review phases ✅
- **995-999**: Wrap-up → git_operations & knowledge_generation phases ✅

### Refinement Opportunities
1. **Make phase mapping explicit** - Add workflow_phase field to tasks
2. **Enhance task metadata** - Include phase sequence and prerequisites
3. **Refine number ranges** - Better align with all 8 workflow phases
4. **Add phase validation** - Ensure tasks execute in correct phase order
