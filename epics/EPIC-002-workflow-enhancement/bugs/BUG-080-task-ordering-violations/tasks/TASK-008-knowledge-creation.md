## Completion Notes
Successfully captured comprehensive knowledge about the workflow-based task ordering system including:

1. **Task Number Range System** (001-009, 010-994, 995-999)
   - How ranges map to Inner Workflow phases
   - Why specific numbers have specific meanings
   - The +1 pattern for peer reviews

2. **Phase Mapping and Enforcement**
   - Direct mapping of task numbers to workflow phases
   - Phase prerequisites and enforcement mechanisms
   - Prevention of common anti-patterns

3. **Implementation Insights**
   - How icc-plan-tasks enforces the system
   - Integration with priority execution
   - Benefits realized from systematic ordering

All knowledge has been stored in the memory system with appropriate relationships for future retrieval and application.
