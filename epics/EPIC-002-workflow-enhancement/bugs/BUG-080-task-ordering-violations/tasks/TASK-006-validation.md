# TASK-006: [QA-Engineer] Validate Workflow Ordering

## Overview
**Task ID:** TASK-006
**Title:** [QA-Engineer] Validate Workflow Ordering
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Assigned To:** @QA-Engineer
**Priority:** P0 (critical_path)
**Type:** validation
**Completed:** 2025-01-20

## Description
Test that the workflow-based task ordering system works correctly and prevents violations.

## Subtasks
1. **Test correct ordering**
   - Create sample tasks
   - Verify proper sequence
   - Check phase alignment

2. **Test violation prevention**
   - Try to create out-of-order tasks
   - Verify enforcement works
   - Check error messages

3. **Test edge cases**
   - Complex task dependencies
   - Multiple implementation tasks
   - Parallel execution scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Correct ordering verified
- [x] Violations prevented
- [x] Edge cases handled
- [x] System reliable

## Dependencies
- TASK-003 (need implementation)

## Output
- Test results report: `validation-report.md` ✅
- Validation confirmation: PASSED ✅
- Any issues found: None - system fully functional ✅

## Completion Notes
Created comprehensive validation report that:
1. Validated task number range mapping to workflow phases
2. Confirmed phase sequencing follows Inner Workflow
3. Verified automatic review generation works correctly
4. Tested priority and dependency management
5. Validated edge cases and violation prevention

The validation report is saved at `epics/EPIC-002-workflow-enhancement/bugs/BUG-080-task-ordering-violations/validation-report.md`

**Validation Result: PASSED** - The workflow-based task ordering system is fully functional and correctly enforces phase-based sequencing.
