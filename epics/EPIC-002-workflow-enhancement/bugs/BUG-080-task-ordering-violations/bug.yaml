title: "Task Planning Doesn't Follow Workflow Ordering"
description: |
  icc-plan-tasks doesn't implement proper workflow-based task ordering:
  - Knowledge Retrieval and Research should ALWAYS come first
  - Peer Review, Documentation, Testing, Git operations should ALWAYS come last
  - Current implementation doesn't follow inner/outer workflow patterns
  
severity: CRITICAL
priority: P0
status: COMPLETED
phase: DONE
workflow_type: "outer"
workflow_phase: "knowledge_generation"

identified_issues:
  - "No workflow-based task ordering"
  - "Tasks created in wrong sequence"
  - "Workflow patterns not followed"

root_cause: |
  Task planning command created without referencing workflow templates.
  No integration with inner/outer workflow patterns.

impact:
  - Tasks executed in wrong order
  - Workflow benefits lost
  - Quality issues from improper sequencing

acceptance_criteria:
  - Implement workflow-based ordering
  - Knowledge/Research tasks first
  - Review/Doc/Test/Git tasks last
  - Follow inner/outer patterns
