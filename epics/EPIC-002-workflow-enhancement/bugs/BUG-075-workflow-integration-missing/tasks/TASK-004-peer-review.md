# TASK-004: [AI-Architect] Review Workflow Integration

## Overview
**Task ID:** TASK-004
**Title:** [AI-Architect] Review Workflow Integration
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Assigned To:** @AI-Architect
**Priority:** P1 (critical_path)
**Type:** peer_review

## Description
Review the workflow integration to ensure architectural alignment and behavioral clarity.

## Subtasks
1. **Validate integration completeness** ✅
   - Check all behaviors reference workflows
   - Verify commands follow patterns
   - Ensure no gaps remain

2. **Review architectural alignment** ✅
   - Confirm workflows properly integrated
   - Validate behavioral consistency
   - Check enforcement mechanisms

3. **Assess behavioral clarity** ✅
   - Ensure AI can follow workflows
   - Verify no pseudo-code introduced
   - Confirm actionable instructions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Integration architecturally sound (PARTIAL - concept good, implementation flawed)
- [x] Behavioral clarity maintained (FAILED - pseudo-code contamination)
- [x] Workflows properly enforced (YES - phase enforcement working)
- [x] No pseudo-code present (FAILED - 7 files contaminated)

## Dependencies
- TASK-003 (implementation complete)

## Parallel Execution
- Review aspects can parallelize

## Output
- Architecture review report ✅
- Integration validation ✅
- Required fixes identified ✅

## Review Findings

### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **Pseudo-code Contamination** - 7 behavioral files contain pseudo-code blocks
2. **Function Syntax** - Using "function():" instead of behavioral patterns
3. **Code Blocks** - Using ```pseudocode blocks instead of markdown

### Architectural Assessment:
- **Workflow Integration:** Good concept, partial implementation
- **Phase Enforcement:** Well-designed and functional
- **Command Updates:** Properly integrated
- **Behavioral Clarity:** FAILED due to pseudo-code

### Required Actions:
1. Remove ALL pseudo-code from behavioral files
2. Convert to pure behavioral markdown
3. Ensure AI-readable format throughout

**Status:** COMPLETED with MAJOR ISSUES FOUND
**Recommendation:** BLOCK until pseudo-code removed
