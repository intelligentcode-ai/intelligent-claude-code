# TASK-003: [AI-Engineer] Integrate Workflows into Behaviors

## Overview
**Task ID:** TASK-003
**Title:** [AI-Engineer] Integrate Workflows into Behaviors
**Status:** PLANNED
**Assigned To:** @AI-Engineer
**Priority:** P1 (critical_path)
**Type:** implementation

## Description
Update behavioral files to properly reference and use workflow patterns for execution.

## Subtasks
1. **Update lean-workflow-executor.md**
   - Add explicit workflow phase references
   - Integrate workflow hooks into execution
   - Reference workflow templates directly

2. **Update command behaviors**
   - Make plan commands follow outer workflow
   - Make task execution follow inner workflow
   - Add workflow validation checks

3. **Add workflow enforcement**
   - Ensure proper phase transitions
   - Validate task ordering per workflows
   - Add workflow compliance checks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Behaviors reference workflows explicitly
- [ ] Commands follow workflow patterns
- [ ] Enforcement mechanisms in place
- [ ] No pseudo-code added

## Dependencies
- TASK-002 (patterns needed)

## Parallel Execution
- Can update different behaviors in parallel

## Output
- Updated behavioral files
- Workflow integration complete
- Execution patterns aligned
