title: "Inner and Outer Workflows Not Integrated"
description: |
  The inner and outer workflow templates exist but are NOT referenced or used
  by any behaviors or commands. This breaks our entire execution model.
  
severity: HIGH
priority: P1
status: IN PROGRESS
phase: EXECUTE

identified_issues:
  - "Workflows not referenced in behaviors"
  - "Commands don't follow workflow patterns"
  - "icc-plan-tasks doesn't use workflow task ordering"
  - "No workflow integration in execution"

root_cause: |
  Workflow templates were created but never integrated into the behavioral
  system or command execution patterns.

impact:
  - Tasks not created in proper order
  - Workflow benefits not realized
  - Execution patterns inconsistent

acceptance_criteria:
  - Integrate workflows into behaviors
  - Commands reference and use workflows
  - Task planning follows workflow patterns
  - Proper task ordering implemented
