title: "Pseudo-Code Contamination in All Behaviors"
description: |
  All behavioral files contain pseudo-code instead of precise behavioral text.
  This violates our core architecture and makes behaviors unreadable by Claude Code.
  
severity: CRITICAL
priority: P0
status: COMPLETED
phase: DONE
workflow_type: "outer"
workflow_phase: "knowledge_generation"

identified_issues:
  - "Pseudo-code functions throughout behaviors"
  - "initialize_system(), processError(), etc. instead of text"
  - "Behaviors cannot be interpreted properly"
  - "Architecture violation"

root_cause: |
  Implementation used programming patterns instead of behavioral documentation
  patterns as specified in our architecture.

impact:
  - Behaviors cannot guide system operation
  - Claude Code cannot understand intent
  - System behavior unpredictable

acceptance_criteria:
  - Remove ALL pseudo-code from behaviors
  - Replace with SHORT, PRECISE behavioral text
  - Ensure behaviors use commands for actions
  - Validate behavioral clarity
