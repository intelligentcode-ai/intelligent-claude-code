# TASK-010: [AI-Engineer] Create Behavioral Pattern Learning

## Overview
**Task ID:** TASK-010
**Title:** [AI-Engineer] Create Behavioral Pattern Learning
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Assigned To:** @AI-Engineer
**Priority:** P0 (optional)
**Type:** knowledge_creation

## Description
Capture learnings about behavioral patterns vs pseudo-code for future system maintenance and development.

## Subtasks
1. **Document pattern discoveries**
   - What patterns work best
   - How to write clear behaviors
   - Command integration patterns
   - Brevity vs clarity balance

2. **Capture anti-pattern lessons**
   - Why pseudo-code fails
   - Common contamination sources
   - Prevention strategies
   - Detection methods

3. **Store team knowledge**
   - Create learning entities
   - Link to BUG-074
   - Share with all roles
   - Enable future prevention

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Learnings documented
- [x] Patterns captured
- [x] Knowledge stored
- [x] Team can access

## Dependencies
- TASK-009 (after git operations)

## Parallel Execution
- Can overlap with git operations

## Output
- Learning documents created
- Memory entities stored
- Knowledge accessible
- Prevention strategies documented

## Completion Summary

Created comprehensive learning capture for BUG-074:

1. **Memory Entities Created:**
   - `Learning-BehavioralPatterns-2025-01-19` - Core pattern discoveries
   - `Learning-PseudoCodeAntiPatterns-2025-01-19` - Why pseudo-code fails
   - `Learning-BehavioralWritingGuidelines-2025-01-19` - How to write behaviors
   - `CommandPattern-BUG-074` - Command structure patterns
   - `TeamKnowledge-BehavioralSystem` - Team-wide knowledge sharing

2. **Documentation Created:**
   - `/docs/BEHAVIORAL-PATTERNS-GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive guide with:
     - Good vs bad pattern examples
     - Core principles and writing checklist
     - Anti-pattern detection methods
     - Team responsibilities
     - Prevention strategies

3. **Key Learnings Captured:**
   - Behaviors use natural language, not code syntax
   - Flow notation: → for sequence, • for options
   - Tools specified explicitly: "Use [Tool] to [action]"
   - Conditions as simple IF/ELSE text
   - No functions, variables, or programming constructs

4. **Prevention Strategy Established:**
   - Education first for new team members
   - Early review to catch contamination
   - Pattern library for reference
   - Regular audits for pseudo-code creep

This knowledge will help prevent future pseudo-code contamination and ensure all behavioral files remain clean, concise, and AI-executable.
