- [x] Anti-pattern examples
- [x] Validation guidelines
- [x] Future-proof standards

## Dependencies
- TASK-006 (incorporate review feedback)

## Parallel Execution
- Can start with implementation phase

## Output
- Pattern standards document ✓ (learnings/behavioral-pattern-standards.md)
- Anti-pattern guide ✓ (included in standards)
- Validation checklist ✓ (automated and manual processes)

## Completion Summary
Created comprehensive behavioral pattern standards document that:
1. Defines proper behavioral patterns with clear examples
2. Documents anti-patterns from the cleanup work with explanations
