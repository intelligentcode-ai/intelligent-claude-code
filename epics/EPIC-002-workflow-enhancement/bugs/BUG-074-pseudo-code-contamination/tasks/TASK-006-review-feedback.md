# TASK-006: Peer Review Feedback

## Review Summary
**Date:** 2025-01-19
**Reviewer:** @AI-Architect
**Status:** REVIEW FAILED - Major issues found

## Critical Issue Found

### lean-workflow-executor.md Still Contains Pseudo-Code
The core behavioral file `lean-workflow-executor.md` still contains function declarations in pseudo-code format:
- Line 11: `initialize_system():`
- Line 12: `read_assignment():`
- Line 13: `execute_phase():`
- Line 14: `assign_role():`
- Line 15: `update_progress():`

This is a **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE VIOLATION**. The file was supposed to be cleaned but still contains programming constructs.

## Files Successfully Cleaned

The following files have been properly cleaned and comply with behavioral standards:

### ✅ role-assignment-validator.md
- Clean behavioral descriptions
- No pseudo-code remaining
- Clear command references
- Properly formatted examples

### ✅ l3-continuous-engine.md
- Excellent behavioral text
- Clear section organization
- Configuration shown as YAML (acceptable)
- No function declarations

### ✅ task-queue-manager.md
- Clean behavioral format
- Mathematical formulas shown clearly
- Configuration as YAML
- No programming constructs

### ✅ auto-continue-triggers.md
- Well-structured behavioral text
- Clear trigger flows
- Proper command references
- No pseudo-code

### ✅ progress-monitor.md
- Clean behavioral descriptions
- Clear handler replacements
- Good organization
- No programming logic

### ✅ work-discovery-engine.md
- Excellent behavioral format
- Clear source descriptions
- Configuration as YAML
- No pseudo-code

### ✅ role-detection-engine.md
- Clean and concise
- Good examples in YAML
- No programming constructs
- Clear behavioral flow

## Architectural Compliance Assessment

### What's Working Well
1. Most files (7 out of 8 reviewed) are properly cleaned
2. Behavioral descriptions are clear and precise
3. Command references are properly used
4. YAML examples and configuration blocks are appropriate
5. Files are SHORT and PRECISE as required

### What Needs Immediate Fix
1. **lean-workflow-executor.md** - The most critical file still has pseudo-code
2. This blocks architectural compliance certification

## Required Actions

1. **IMMEDIATELY** clean lean-workflow-executor.md to remove ALL function declarations
2. Replace with behavioral descriptions like the other cleaned files
3. Ensure NO programming constructs remain
4. Re-submit for review once cleaned

## Recommendations

The team did excellent work on 7 out of 8 files. The pattern is clear:
- Use behavioral descriptions ("Load settings → Initialize controllers")
- Reference commands without function syntax
- Keep descriptions SHORT and PRECISE
- Use YAML for examples and configuration only

Apply this same pattern to lean-workflow-executor.md to complete the cleanup.

## Review Decision

**FAILED** - Cannot approve with pseudo-code remaining in the core behavioral file.

Once lean-workflow-executor.md is properly cleaned, the entire system will be architecturally compliant.
