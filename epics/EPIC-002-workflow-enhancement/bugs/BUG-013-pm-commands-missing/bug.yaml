  CRITICAL BUG: Essential PM management commands are missing from the system.
  
  MISSING COMMANDS:
  - @PM init (Initialize/reset system state)
  - @PM refresh (Refresh team capabilities and configuration)
  - @PM reset (Reset system to clean state)
  
  CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
  - Commands don't exist in current system
  - No way to properly initialize system
  - No way to refresh team capabilities
  - No way to reset system state
  
  EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
  - @PM init should initialize/reset system state
  - @PM refresh should refresh team capabilities and configuration
  - @PM reset should reset system to clean state
  - System management commands should be functional
  
  IMPACT:
  - No proper system initialization
  - No way to manage system state
  - Cannot refresh or reset system
  - System management is broken

acceptance_criteria:
  - @PM init command restored and functional
  - @PM refresh command restored and functional
  - @PM reset command restored and functional
  - System management commands work as expected
  - Proper system initialization possible
