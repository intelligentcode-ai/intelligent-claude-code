# TASK-001 Architecture Design - COMPLETE

**Task:** Design correct workflow architecture with proper level separation  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Architect  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 14:30:00

## Architecture Analysis

### Current State Problem
- Git operations missing from inner workflow (per task)
- Reviews missing from inner workflow (per task)  
- Learning processes missing from both levels
- Knowledge utilization incomplete

### Correct Architecture Design

#### Inner Workflow (Per Task)
**Git Operations:**
- Commit per task completion
- Push per task completion
- Proper commit messages with task evidence

**Review Process:**
- Peer review per task
- Domain expert assignment via icc:validate-assignments()
- Review completion before task closure

**Learning Integration:**
- Knowledge consultation before task (knowledge_retrieval phase)
- Learning capture after task (knowledge_generation phase)
- Pattern application during task execution

#### Outer Workflow (Per Story/Bug)
**Git Operations:**
- Branch creation per story/bug
- Merge coordination per story/bug completion
- Integration validation

**Learning Integration:**
- Knowledge consultation before story/bug (knowledge_retrieval phase)
- Learning synthesis across tasks (knowledge_generation phase)
- Pattern extraction at story level

### Implementation Requirements

#### Inner Workflow Updates Needed
1. Add git_operations section with commits/pushes
2. Ensure peer_review phase is properly integrated
3. Verify learning processes in knowledge_retrieval and knowledge_generation phases

#### Outer Workflow Updates Needed
1. Add branch management in git_operations
2. Add merge coordination processes
3. Ensure learning synthesis across multiple tasks

### Current Template Analysis

**Inner Workflow (inner-workflow-corrected.yaml):**
- ✅ Has knowledge_retrieval phase
- ✅ Has peer_review phase
- ✅ Has knowledge_generation phase
- ❌ Missing git commits/pushes per task
- ❌ Git operations only reference story-level branching

**Outer Workflow (outer-workflow-corrected.yaml):**
- ✅ Has knowledge_retrieval phase
- ✅ Has knowledge_generation phase
- ❌ Missing branch management
- ❌ Missing merge coordination
- ❌ No learning synthesis across tasks

## Ready for Implementation

Architecture design complete. Next task: Update inner workflow template to include git commits/pushes per task.
