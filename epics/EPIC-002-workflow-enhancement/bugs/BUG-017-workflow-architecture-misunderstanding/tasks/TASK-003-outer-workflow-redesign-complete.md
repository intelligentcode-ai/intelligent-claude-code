# TASK-003 Outer Workflow Redesign - COMPLETE

**Task:** Redesign outer workflow template with proper branching/merging/learning integration  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Engineer  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 14:35:00

## Implementation Summary

Successfully updated outer-workflow-corrected.yaml to include proper git operations, merge coordination, and learning synthesis at the story/bug level.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Git Operations Phase
- **New phase:** `git_operations` between task_decomposition and acceptance_criteria
- **Branch creation:** Template "{{type}}/{{id}}-{{title-slug}}" per story/bug
- **Merge coordination:** Validate all task commits before integration
- **Integration preparation:** Ready for main branch merge

### 2. Enhanced Learning Synthesis
- **Cross-task learning:** Synthesize learning across all tasks in story
- **Pattern identification:** Extract architecture patterns and process improvements
- **Story-level insights:** Capture team collaboration patterns
- **Memory storage:** Store StoryLearning entities with comprehensive insights

### 3. Updated Acceptance Criteria
- **Branch readiness:** Added "Branch ready for merge" to completion criteria
- **Integration validation:** Ensure all tasks properly integrated
- **Learning synthesis:** Confirm learning captured across tasks

### 4. Proper Level Assignment
- **Outer workflow:** Branching and merging per story/bug
- **Inner workflow coordination:** Coordinate task-level commits
- **Clear separation:** Outer handles story-level git operations

## Git Operations Structure

```yaml
git_operations:
  workflow_level: "outer"
  story_level:
    branches: "Per story/bug (outer workflow)"
    merges: "Per story/bug completion (outer workflow)"
    
  branch_standards:
    template: "{{type}}/{{id}}-{{title-slug}}"
    types: ["story", "bug"]
    
  merge_standards:
    validation_required:
      - "All task commits present"
      - "No merge conflicts"
      - "All tests passing"
      - "All reviews approved"
      - "Learning synthesized"
```

## Learning Synthesis Structure

```yaml
synthesize_task_learning:
  inputs:
    - "Task learning entities"
    - "Task outcomes"
    - "Cross-task patterns"
  outputs:
    - "Story-level insights"
    - "Process improvements"
    - "Architecture patterns"
```

## Ready for Testing

Outer workflow now properly handles:
- ✅ Branch creation per story/bug
- ✅ Merge coordination per story/bug
- ✅ Learning synthesis across tasks
- ✅ Knowledge utilization at story level
- ✅ Integration coordination
