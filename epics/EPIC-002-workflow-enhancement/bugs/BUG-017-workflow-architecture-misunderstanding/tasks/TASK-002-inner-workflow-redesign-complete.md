# TASK-002 Inner Workflow Redesign - COMPLETE

**Task:** Redesign inner workflow template with proper git/review/learning integration  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Engineer  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 14:32:00

## Implementation Summary

Successfully updated inner-workflow-corrected.yaml to include proper git operations, review processes, and learning integration at the task level.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Git Operations Phase
- **New phase:** `git_operations` between peer_review and task_completion
- **Commit per task:** Template "{{task_id}}: {{summary}}" with evidence
- **Push per task:** Validation required before push
- **Privacy handling:** Sanitize AI references if git_privacy enabled

### 2. Enhanced Learning Integration
- **Knowledge retrieval:** Already present at task start
- **Learning storage:** Added `store_learning` step to capture TaskLearning entities
- **Memory integration:** Store task approach, challenges, solutions, patterns

### 3. Updated Validation Requirements
- **Git operations:** Must complete commits and pushes
- **Learning captured:** Must store learning entities
- **Push validation:** Tests passing, no conflicts, deliverables complete

### 4. Proper Level Assignment
- **Inner workflow:** Commits and pushes per task
- **Outer workflow reference:** Branching handled at story level
- **Clear separation:** Inner handles task-level git operations

## Git Operations Structure

```yaml
git_operations:
  workflow_level: "inner"
  task_level:
    commits: "Per task completion (inner workflow)"
    pushes: "Per task completion (inner workflow)"
    
  commit_standards:
    template: "{{task_id}}: {{summary}}"
    evidence_required: true
    
  push_standards:
    validation_required:
      - "Tests passing"
      - "No merge conflicts"
      - "Task deliverables complete"
      - "Learning captured"
```

## Ready for Peer Review

Inner workflow now properly handles:
- ✅ Git commits per task
- ✅ Git pushes per task
- ✅ Peer reviews per task (already existed)
- ✅ Learning processes per task
- ✅ Knowledge utilization per task
