## Documentation Updates

Successfully updated CLAUDE.md to document the new workflow architecture with proper level separation.

## Changes Made

### 1. File Editing Patterns Section
- **Enhanced workflow templates section** with inner/outer workflow distinction
- **Added workflow responsibilities** for each level
- **Clarified editing patterns** for developers

### 2. Role Coordination Section  
- **Added Workflow Architecture subsection** with comprehensive documentation
- **Inner workflow details**: Git operations, peer reviews, learning per task
- **Outer workflow details**: Branching, merging, learning synthesis per story/bug

### 3. Architecture Documentation

#### Inner Workflow (Per Task)
```markdown
- Git commits and pushes per task completion
- Peer reviews per task by domain experts  
- Learning capture per task (TaskLearning entities)
- Knowledge utilization from task-specific patterns
```

#### Outer Workflow (Per Story/Bug)
```markdown
- Branch creation and merge coordination per story/bug
- Learning synthesis across multiple tasks (StoryLearning entities)
- Integration validation and main branch preparation
- Cross-task pattern extraction and architecture insights
```

## Documentation Structure

### Updated Sections
- **File Editing Patterns**: Added workflow template editing guidance
- **Role Coordination**: Added workflow architecture subsection
- **Architecture Overview**: Enhanced with workflow level separation

### Maintained Sections
- **Memory Integration**: Preserved existing documentation
- **Role Assignment Validation**: Kept validation system documentation
- **Command Chain Patterns**: Maintained command documentation

## Developer Benefits

### Clear Guidance
- **Workflow template editing**: Developers know which file handles what
- **Level separation**: Clear understanding of inner vs outer responsibilities
- **Architecture patterns**: Proper workflow coordination documented

### Implementation Support
- **Git operations**: Clear documentation of commit/push patterns
- **Learning integration**: TaskLearning and StoryLearning entity usage
- **Review processes**: Peer review requirements per level

## Ready for Git Operations

Documentation now accurately reflects the corrected workflow architecture with proper level separation and comprehensive workflow guidance.
