  CRITICAL: System misunderstands subagent deployment pattern!
  
  WRONG Understanding:
  - Create parallel subagents for each BUG
  - Spawn 5 subagents for 5 bugs
  
  CORRECT Pattern:
  - Create subagent PER TASK within a bug
  - Only when PARALLELIZATION is applicable
  - Tasks marked as parallelizable get subagents
  - Sequential tasks execute in order
  
  This violates the task-level parallelization architecture!

impact: "Incorrect parallelization at wrong granularity level"
