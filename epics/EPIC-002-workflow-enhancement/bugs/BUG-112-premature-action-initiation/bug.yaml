# BUG-112: Work Item Creation Triggers Immediate Action Incorrectly

## Problem Description
Creating Epic/Story/Bug files incorrectly triggers immediate action planning and execution instead of continuing current work.

## Current Incorrect Behavior
- Bug creation immediately starts task decomposition
- Current work is abandoned for new work item
- Violates assignment-driven execution principle

## Expected Correct Behavior
- Work item creation is logging only
- Current work continues unless work item is utterly important
- Current work continues unless user explicitly demands switch

## Impact Assessment
- **Priority:** P1 (High - affects workflow continuity)
- **Impact:** High - disrupts work prioritization
- **Complexity:** Medium - requires workflow logic correction

## Root Cause
Misunderstanding of outer workflow action triggers
