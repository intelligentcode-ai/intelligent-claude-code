  CRITICAL BUG: L3 continuous progression is not working in the simplified system.
  
  CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
  - System stops frequently even in L3 mode
  - No continuous progression despite autonomous configuration
  - System requires constant user intervention
  - Autonomous operation is broken
  
  EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
  - L3 mode should enable continuous progression
  - System should work autonomously without frequent stops
  - Continuous workflow should be possible
  - Minimal user intervention required
  
  IMPACT:
  - L3 autonomy is not functional
  - Continuous progression impossible
  - User must constantly intervene
  - System efficiency severely reduced
  - Autonomous operation fails

acceptance_criteria:
  - L3 mode enables continuous progression
  - System works autonomously without frequent stops
  - Continuous workflow possible with minimal intervention
  - Autonomous operation functional
  - L3 autonomy level working as designed

  autonomy_level: "L3"
