# TASK-004 Manual Testing

**Task:** Test L3 continuous progression  
**Assigned to:** @QA-Engineer  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Priority:** critical_path  
**Dependencies:** [TASK-003]

## Manual Test Cases

### Continuous Execution Test
1. **Multi-Task Progression**
   - Set autonomy_level: "L3"
   - Assign multiple tasks
   - Verify continuous execution without stops
   - Check auto-progression between tasks

2. **Phase Transition Test**
   - Complete implementation task
   - Verify auto-start of testing
   - Complete testing
   - Verify auto-start of review
   - Continue through all phases

### Stop Condition Test
1. **L3 Stop Conditions**
   - Test business impact decision (should stop)
   - Test security violation (should stop)
   - Test data loss risk (should stop)
   - Test quality gate failure after correction (should stop)

2. **Non-Stop Conditions**
   - Test normal errors (should continue)
   - Test completed tasks (should continue)
   - Test reviews (should continue)
   - Test documentation (should continue)

### Progress Visibility Test
1. **Progress Tracking**
   - Verify todo list updates automatically
   - Check progress logs generated
   - Verify milestone summaries provided
   - Confirm user stays informed

2. **Auto-Action Logging**
   - Verify all auto-actions logged
   - Check reasons documented
   - Verify audit trail maintained

## Success Criteria

- L3 mode enables continuous progression
- System works without frequent stops
- Only critical issues cause stops
- Progress remains visible to user
- Autonomous operation functional
