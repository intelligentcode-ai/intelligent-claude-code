# TASK-001 Autonomy Architecture Design

**Task:** Design L3 continuous progression system  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Architect  
**Status:** PLANNED  
**Priority:** blocking  
**Dependencies:** none

## Architecture Requirements

### Current Problems
- System stops frequently even in L3 mode
- No continuous progression despite autonomous configuration
- Requires constant user intervention
- Autonomous operation broken

### L3 Autonomy Design

#### Continuous Execution Loop
```pseudocode
FUNCTION l3ContinuousLoop():
    WHILE autonomy_level == "L3":
        nextTask = getNextPriorityTask()
        IF nextTask.exists:
            executeTask(nextTask)
            updateProgress()
            checkForNewWork()
        ELSE:
            checkForPendingWork()
            wait(100ms)  // Brief pause before recheck
```

#### Stop Conditions (L3 Only)
- Business impact decisions
- Security violations
- Data loss risks
- Quality gate failures (auto-correct first)

#### Auto-Continue Patterns
- Task completion → Next task
- Review completion → Continue work
- Documentation done → Git operations
- Git complete → Next bug/story

### Implementation Design

#### Task Queue Management
- Priority-based execution (P0→P1→P2→P3)
- Automatic task progression
- Parallel task coordination
- No unnecessary stops

#### Progress Tracking
- Real-time status updates
- Automatic phase transitions
- Continuous workflow execution
- Minimal user intervention

#### Error Handling
- Auto-correction attempts
- Graceful degradation
- Continue on non-critical errors
- Log issues for later review
