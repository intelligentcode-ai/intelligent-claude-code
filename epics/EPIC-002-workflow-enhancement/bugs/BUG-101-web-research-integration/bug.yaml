title: "Web Research Integration Missing from Workflows - Systemic Knowledge Gap"
description: |
  The system fails to integrate web research (WebSearch, Brave Search, Context7)
  into workflows when internal knowledge is insufficient. This causes:
  - Assumptions instead of fact-finding
  - Trial-and-error instead of best practices research
  - Framework knowledge gaps that could be filled via Context7
  - Missing current documentation and API updates
  
  Web research MUST be part of workflows when system knowledge is insufficient.
  
severity: HIGH
priority: P1
status: PLANNED
phase: PLAN
workflow_phase: story_creation

identified_issues:
  - "No web research integration in behavioral workflows"
  - "Missing Context7 framework knowledge integration"
  - "WebSearch/Brave Search not used for best practices"
  - "Assumptions made instead of researching facts"
  - "Framework documentation not consulted dynamically"
  - "API changes and updates not researched"
  - "Trial-and-error approach instead of research-first"

root_cause: |
  Workflows designed without external knowledge acquisition patterns.
  No behavioral triggers for research when internal knowledge insufficient.
  Missing integration with available MCP research tools.
  
impact:
  - Wasted time on trial-and-error approaches
  - Outdated or incorrect implementation patterns
  - Missing best practices from current documentation
  - Framework integration issues that could be avoided
  - Poor quality decisions due to knowledge gaps
  - System assumptions instead of verified facts

acceptance_criteria:
  - Integrate web research triggers into workflows
  - Add Context7 framework knowledge acquisition
  - Include WebSearch/Brave Search for best practices
  - Create research-first behavioral patterns
  - Add automatic research triggers for unknowns
  - Ensure current documentation is consulted
