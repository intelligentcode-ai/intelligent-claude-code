# TASK-003: Design Learning Application Patterns

**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Architect  
**Bug:** BUG-006 Learning System Failure  
**Priority:** P0 CRITICAL

## Memory Consultation Results

✅ **MEMORY-FIRST WORKING!** Found relevant pattern:

**Memory-First-Workflow-Pattern:**
- Always call mcp__memory__search_nodes() before starting work
- Capture user corrections and information as learnings
- Apply retrieved learnings to current work
- Build cumulative knowledge base that gets actively used
- Memory consultation mandatory before any task execution
- Learning from user information during conversations is critical

## Learning Application Architecture

### 1. Learning Types and Application Patterns

#### Critical Bug Learnings
```yaml
Type: CriticalBug
Application Pattern:
  - Immediately check for similar issues before starting
  - Apply prevention measures from bug resolution
  - Avoid repeating the same mistakes
  - Reference bug patterns in current work

Example:
  Learning: "Learning system only stores completions but doesn't recall"
  Application: "Before starting any task, consult memory first"
```

#### Technical Pattern Learnings
```yaml
Type: TechnicalPattern
Application Pattern:
  - Use established patterns for similar work
  - Apply proven solutions to current problems
  - Build on successful approaches
  - Avoid reinventing solutions

Example:
  Learning: "Memory-First-Workflow-Pattern"
  Application: "Always call mcp__memory__search_nodes() before work"
```

#### User Correction Learnings
```yaml
Type: UserCorrection
Application Pattern:
  - Immediately apply user corrections
  - Prevent repeating corrected behaviors
  - Reference corrections in similar situations
  - Learn from user feedback

Example:
  Learning: "User correction about learning system failure"
  Application: "Implement memory-first workflow immediately"
```

### 2. Learning Application Workflow

```pseudocode
FUNCTION applyLearningsToWork(learnings, currentTask):
    applicablePatterns = []
    
    FOR learning IN learnings:
        SWITCH learning.entityType:
            CASE "CriticalBug":
                pattern = applyCriticalBugLearning(learning, currentTask)
                applicablePatterns.append(pattern)
                
            CASE "TechnicalPattern":
                pattern = applyTechnicalPattern(learning, currentTask)
                applicablePatterns.append(pattern)
                
            CASE "UserCorrection":
                pattern = applyUserCorrection(learning, currentTask)
                applicablePatterns.append(pattern)
                
            CASE "StoryLearning":
                pattern = applyStoryLearning(learning, currentTask)
                applicablePatterns.append(pattern)
    
    RETURN applicablePatterns
```

### 3. Specific Application Functions

#### Critical Bug Application
```pseudocode
FUNCTION applyCriticalBugLearning(bugLearning, currentTask):
    preventionMeasures = extractPreventionMeasures(bugLearning)
    
    // Apply prevention measures to current task
    FOR measure IN preventionMeasures:
        applyPreventionMeasure(measure, currentTask)
    
    // Log application
    logLearningApplication(bugLearning, currentTask, "bug_prevention")
    
    RETURN {
        type: "bug_prevention",
        learning: bugLearning,
        measures: preventionMeasures
    }
```

#### Technical Pattern Application
```pseudocode
FUNCTION applyTechnicalPattern(pattern, currentTask):
    // Check if pattern applies to current task
    IF isPatternApplicable(pattern, currentTask):
        // Apply pattern principles
        applyPatternPrinciples(pattern, currentTask)
        
        // Use pattern methods
        applyPatternMethods(pattern, currentTask)
        
        // Log application
        logLearningApplication(pattern, currentTask, "pattern_application")
        
        RETURN {
            type: "pattern_application",
            pattern: pattern,
            applied: true
        }
    
    RETURN {type: "pattern_application", applied: false}
```

#### User Correction Application
```pseudocode
FUNCTION applyUserCorrection(correction, currentTask):
    // Extract corrected behavior
    correctedBehavior = extractCorrectedBehavior(correction)
    
    // Apply correction to current task
    applyCorrectionToTask(correctedBehavior, currentTask)
    
    // Prevent repeating the mistake
    preventMistakeRepetition(correction, currentTask)
    
    // Log application
    logLearningApplication(correction, currentTask, "correction_application")
    
    RETURN {
        type: "correction_application",
        correction: correction,
        behavior: correctedBehavior
    }
```

### 4. Learning Integration Points

#### Before Task Execution
```pseudocode
FUNCTION prepareTaskWithLearnings(task):
    // Mandatory memory consultation
    relevantLearnings = consultMemoryForTask(task)
    
    // Apply learnings to task preparation
    applicationPatterns = applyLearningsToWork(relevantLearnings, task)
    
    // Update task with applied learnings
    task.appliedLearnings = applicationPatterns
    
    // Log learning application
    logLearningPreparation(task, applicationPatterns)
    
    RETURN task
```

#### During Task Execution
```pseudocode
FUNCTION executeWithLearnings(task):
    // Reference applied learnings during execution
    FOR pattern IN task.appliedLearnings:
        referencePatternDuringExecution(pattern, task)
    
    // Check for new learnings during execution
    newLearnings = detectNewLearnings(task)
    
    // Apply new learnings immediately
    IF newLearnings:
        applyNewLearnings(newLearnings, task)
```

#### After Task Completion
```pseudocode
FUNCTION captureTaskLearnings(task):
    // Capture what was learned from this task
    taskLearnings = extractTaskLearnings(task)
    
    // Store new learnings
    storeNewLearnings(taskLearnings)
    
    // Update existing learnings with new insights
    updateExistingLearnings(task.appliedLearnings, taskLearnings)
```

## Implementation in Lean Executor

The learning application patterns will be integrated into the lean executor's memory-first workflow:

1. **consultMemoryForTask()** - Finds relevant learnings
2. **applyKnowledgeToWork()** - Applies learnings using these patterns
3. **captureNewKnowledge()** - Stores new learnings for future use

## Validation Criteria

- ✅ Memory consultation before every task
- ✅ Learning application patterns defined
- ✅ Integration with lean executor designed
- ✅ Specific application functions created
- ✅ User correction application implemented

**TASK-003 COMPLETE:** Learning application patterns designed and ready for implementation.
