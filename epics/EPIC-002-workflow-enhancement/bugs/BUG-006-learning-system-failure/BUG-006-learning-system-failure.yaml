title: Learning System Not Actually Learning - Critical Failure
type: bug
status: COMPLETED
priority: P0
phase: DONE
epic: EPIC-002
created_date: 2025-07-16
severity: CRITICAL
description: >
  The learning system is fundamentally broken. It only captures task completions
  but does not learn from information provided or lessons learned. It also fails
  to recall anything before doing tasks, which defeats the entire purpose of
  learning and continuous improvement.

reproduction_steps:
  - System completes tasks and stores completion information
  - System starts new similar tasks without consulting memory
  - No recall of previously provided information or lessons
  - Learning entities created but not consulted before work

expected_behavior:
  - Before starting any task, system should consult memory for relevant learnings
  - Should learn from information provided during conversations
  - Should apply lessons learned to prevent repeating mistakes
  - Should build knowledge base that actually gets used

actual_behavior:
  - Only stores task completion information
  - Never consults memory before starting tasks
  - Doesn't learn from information provided
  - Learning system is purely append-only with no recall

impact_analysis:
  affected_users: "All users"
  frequency: "Always"
  business_impact: "Learning system non-functional"
  workaround: "Manual reminders"

root_cause_analysis: |
  Learning system designed as append-only storage without recall mechanism.
  No integration with task execution to consult memory first.
  Focus on storing completions rather than learning from information.
  
resolution_criteria:
  - Memory consultation mandatory before starting any task
  - Learn from information provided during conversations
  - Apply lessons learned to prevent repetition
  - Build cumulative knowledge that gets actively used
  - Demonstrate actual learning through behavior changes

embedded_config:
  autonomy_level: "L3"
  pm_always_active: true
  blocking_enabled: false
  git_privacy: true
  
technical_details:
  current_problem: |
    - mcp__memory__search_nodes() called after work, not before
    - Only stores task completion entities
    - No integration with work startup to consult memory
    - Information provided by users not captured as learnings
    
  required_solution: |
    - Mandatory memory consultation before any task
    - Learn from user information and corrections
    - Apply retrieved learnings to current work
    - Build cumulative knowledge base

notes:
  - P0 Critical bug affecting core learning functionality
  - Based on user identification of fundamental learning failure
  - Learning system currently useless without recall mechanism
  - Must be fixed to make system actually intelligent
