# BUG-064 Resolution: False Alarm

## Summary
This bug was marked as a FALSE ALARM after investigation revealed the scoring system is functioning correctly as designed.

## Investigation Findings

### Initial Assumption (Incorrect)
- Assumed the scoring system used a 0-500 point range
- Believed -10 replacement threshold was mathematically impossible to reach

### Actual System Design (Correct)
- Scoring system uses floating-point values starting at 0.0
- Scores CAN go negative through penalty accumulation
- Penalties range from -1.0P to -2.0P per violation
- Multiple violations can easily reach -10.0P threshold
- System is mathematically consistent and working as intended

## Root Cause of False Alarm
1. Made assumptions without verifying the actual scoring system implementation
2. Did not review codebase to understand the design
3. Failed to analyze how penalties accumulate
4. Created bug report prematurely without proper investigation

## Lessons Learned
- Always verify assumptions against actual implementation
- Review existing code and documentation before reporting bugs
- Understand the full system behavior before claiming design flaws
- Perform thorough investigation to avoid false alarms

## Status
- **Resolution**: FALSE_ALARM
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Phase**: DONE
- **No code changes required** - system functions correctly
- **No further action needed**

## Time Impact
- Investigation time: ~5 minutes
- Wasted effort on false alarm bug creation and planning
- Demonstrates importance of proper investigation procedures
