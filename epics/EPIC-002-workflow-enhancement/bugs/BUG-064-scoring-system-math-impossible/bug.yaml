problem_description: |
  FALSE ALARM: Initially reported as mathematical impossibility between 0-500 
  point range and -10 replacement threshold. Upon investigation, the "0-500" 
  range was an incorrect assumption. The actual scoring system uses floating-point
  values that can go negative.
  
  Analysis confirmed the system IS mathematically consistent:
  - Scores start at 0.0P, 0.0Q
  - Penalties (-1.0P to -2.0P) can accumulate negatively
  - Multiple violations can reach -10.0P replacement threshold
  - System functions correctly as designed
  
root_cause: |
  FALSE ALARM caused by incorrect assumptions:
  1. Assumed "0-500" score range without verifying actual implementation
  2. Did not check codebase for actual scoring system design
  3. Failed to analyze penalty accumulation mechanism
  4. Rushed to create bug without proper investigation
  5. System design is actually correct and mathematically sound
  
impact: |
  - NO ACTUAL IMPACT - System functions correctly
  - Replacement protocol DOES trigger at -10.0P as designed
  - False alarm wasted development time
  - Demonstrates need for better investigation before bug creation
  - Scoring system operates as intended
