# BUG-121: CRITICAL - System Uses MCP Memory Instead of File-Based Memory

## Problem Description
The system is using MCP memory tool (`mcp__memory__create_entities`) instead of the file-based memory system. This is a fundamental architectural violation.

Evidence from TASK-003 execution:
- Subagent created "Learning-WorkflowAutoTrigger-2025-01-21" using MCP memory
- Should have created file at: `.claude/memory/entities/learnings/2025/01/` (within project)

## Critical Impact
- **Architecture Violation:** Core file-based memory system bypassed
- **Data Loss:** Memory stored in wrong location, not accessible to file-based searches
- **Learning System Broken:** Learnings not being stored where expected
- **Pattern Detection Failed:** File-based searches won't find MCP-stored memories

## Root Cause
- Subagents are using MCP memory tools instead of file operations
- No behavioral pattern enforcing file-based memory usage
- Missing detection and correction for MCP memory usage

## Expected Behavior
- ALL memory operations use file-based storage
- Learning entities stored at: `.claude/memory/entities/learnings/[YYYY]/[MM]/` (within project)
- NO MCP memory tools should be used
- File-based searches for pattern retrieval

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create behavioral pattern preventing MCP memory usage
- [ ] Force file-based memory operations
- [ ] Add detection for MCP memory attempts
- [ ] Auto-correct to file-based storage
- [ ] Validate no MCP memory calls in workflows
