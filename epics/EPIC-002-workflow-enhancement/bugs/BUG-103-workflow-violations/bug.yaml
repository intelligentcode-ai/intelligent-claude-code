  CRITICAL BLOCKER: The system completely ignores mandatory workflow requirements:
  
  1. OUTER WORKFLOW VIOLATIONS:
     - NO work type detection (detect-work-type)
     - NO PM + Architect triage (require-triage) 
     - NO role validation (validate-assignments)
     - NO approval process (require-approval)
     - Direct bug creation without workflow phases
  
  2. INNER WORKFLOW VIOLATIONS:
     - NO knowledge retrieval before work
     - NO task planning phase
     - NO peer review requirements
     - NO knowledge generation after work
  
  3. VALIDATION CHAIN COMPLETELY BYPASSED:
     detect-work-type → require-triage → validate-assignments → require-approval
     
  This is MORE CRITICAL than the memory bug because it violates the entire 
  architectural foundation of the system!

root_cause: |
  System operates in "freestyle mode" ignoring all behavioral enforcement patterns.
  Workflows are documented but not followed - treating them as optional guidance
  rather than mandatory architecture.

acceptance_criteria:
  - ALL work must follow outer workflow phases
  - ALL tasks must follow inner workflow phases  
  - Validation chain MANDATORY for all assignments
  - PM + Architect triage REQUIRED for all bugs
  - No direct task creation without workflow compliance

technical_details:
  violated_patterns:
    - src/behaviors/lean-workflow-executor.md
    - src/workflow-templates/outer-workflow.yaml
    - src/workflow-templates/inner-workflow.yaml
    - src/behaviors/role-assignment-validator.md
  
  missing_executions:
    - /icc-detect-work-type
    - /icc-require-triage
    - /icc-validate-assignments
    - /icc-require-approval

validation:
  - Verify workflow compliance on all operations
  - Block non-compliant actions
  - Enforce validation chain execution

impact: "ARCHITECTURAL FOUNDATION VIOLATED - System integrity compromised"
