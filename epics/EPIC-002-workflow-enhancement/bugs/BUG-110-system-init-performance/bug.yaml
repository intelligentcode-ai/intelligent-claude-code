# BUG-110: System Initialization Performance Optimization

## Problem Description
Current `/icc-init-system` command execution:
- Takes MINUTES to complete  
- Consumes excessive tokens
- Highly repetitive operations
- Verbose, redundant output generation

## Impact Assessment
- **User Experience:** Poor (minutes of wait time)
- **Token Efficiency:** Critical issue
- **System Usability:** Significantly degraded

## Technical Analysis Required
- Root cause investigation needed
- Performance profiling required
- Token consumption analysis
- Optimization strategy design

## Priority Classification
**P2** - Performance improvement, not system-breaking
**Impact:** Medium - affects user experience but system functional
**Effort:** TBD (requires analysis)
**Complexity:** TBD (requires architectural review)
