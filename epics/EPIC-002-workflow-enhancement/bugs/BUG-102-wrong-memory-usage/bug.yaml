description: |
  CRITICAL: The intelligent-claude-code system is designed as a BEHAVIORAL CONFIGURATION SYSTEM
  using pure Markdown patterns, but it continuously attempts to use MCP Memory integration
  instead of the designed file-based memory approach. This violates the core project principles
  and causes confusion about implementation vs behavioral patterns.

  Root Cause: Misunderstanding of project scope - treating behavioral patterns as code to implement
  rather than patterns to follow using Claude Code's native file operations.

acceptance_criteria:
  - File-based memory patterns correctly guide Claude Code to use native file operations
  - No references to MCP Memory in core memory operations
  - Clear documentation distinguishing behavioral patterns from implementation
  - Validation that memory operations use file system, not external services

technical_details:
  affected_files:
    - src/behaviors/file-based-memory.md
    - src/commands/icc-memory-*.md
    - CLAUDE.md (mentions MCP but should clarify file-based approach)
  
  expected_behavior: |
    - Memory operations create/read markdown files in ~/.claude/memory/
    - Search uses Claude Code's native grep/read tools
    - Learning entities stored as .md files with proper structure
  
  current_behavior: |
    - System attempts to use mcp__memory__* functions
    - Ignores file-based behavioral patterns
    - Treats patterns as unimplemented code

validation:
  - Create memory entity using file-based approach
  - Search memory using grep on file system
  - Verify no MCP Memory calls in normal operations

impact: "Fundamental misunderstanding of project architecture"
