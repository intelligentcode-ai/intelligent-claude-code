# TASK-001: [AI-Architect] Analyze root cause of MCP vs file-based memory confusion

## Objective
Perform comprehensive analysis of why the system continuously uses MCP Memory instead of following file-based memory behavioral patterns.

## Subtasks
1. **Review all memory-related behavioral files** to identify MCP references
2. **Analyze command patterns** that incorrectly suggest MCP implementation
3. **Identify documentation gaps** that cause implementation confusion
4. **Document behavioral vs implementation distinction** clearly

## Acceptance Criteria
- Root cause clearly identified with evidence
- List of all files incorrectly referencing MCP Memory
- Clear explanation of behavioral pattern intent
- Recommendations for pattern corrections
