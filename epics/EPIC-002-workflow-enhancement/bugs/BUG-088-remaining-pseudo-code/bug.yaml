title: "Pseudo-Code Still Exists in config-loader.md and file-management-enforcer.md"
description: |
  Despite BUG-074 completion, pseudo-code still exists EN MASSE in:
  - src/behaviors/config-loader.md
  - src/behaviors/file-management-enforcer.md
  This violates the clean behavioral architecture.
  
severity: CRITICAL
priority: P0
status: COMPLETED
phase: DONE
workflow_type: "outer"
workflow_phase: "knowledge_generation"

identified_issues:
  - "config-loader.md contains pseudo-code functions"
  - "file-management-enforcer.md contains pseudo-code functions"
  - "Behavioral files not readable by AI agents"
  - "Architecture violations remain"

root_cause: |
  These files were not included in BUG-074 cleanup or were created after.
  Still using programming patterns instead of behavioral text.

impact:
  - Behaviors cannot guide system operation
  - AI agents cannot understand intent
  - System behavior unpredictable

acceptance_criteria:
  - Remove ALL pseudo-code from both files
  - Replace with SHORT, PRECISE behavioral text
  - Ensure behaviors use commands for actions
  - Validate behavioral clarity
