  BEHAVIORAL ENHANCEMENT NEEDED: Current validation system (BUG-059) blocks 
  execution when validation fails, but we need TRUE self-correction that
  automatically fixes validation issues without stopping L3 autonomous execution.
  
  Current Issues:
  1. Validation failures cause blocking instead of auto-correction
  2. Missing validation steps are detected but not automatically executed
  3. Role assignment failures stop execution instead of auto-reassigning
  4. L3 autonomy is interrupted by validation failures
  5. No automatic specialist architect consultation when needed
  6. Git settings violations are detected but not auto-corrected
  
  The system needs to evolve from "detect and block" to "detect and auto-fix"
  while maintaining all quality and governance standards.
  
root_cause: |
  The current role-assignment-validator.md implements a blocking validation
  approach where validation failures return errors that stop execution.
  This contradicts the L3 autonomy requirement for continuous execution.
  
  We need a self-correcting approach that:
  - Detects validation issues
  - Automatically applies corrections
  - Logs corrections for transparency
  - Continues execution seamlessly
  
impact: |
  - L3 autonomy frequently interrupted by validation failures
  - Manual intervention required for routine validation corrections
  - Reduced productivity due to blocking validation
  - Inconsistent validation enforcement
  - User frustration with stopped execution
  - Reduced trust in autonomous operation
