# TASK-071: [AI-Engineer] Knowledge Retrieval on Self-Correcting Validation Patterns

## Task Details
- **ID**: TASK-071
- **Title**: Knowledge retrieval on self-correcting validation patterns
- **Type**: Research
- **Assigned to**: @AI-Engineer
- **Effort**: Small
- **Status**: Planned
- **Parent**: BUG-071

## Description
Research existing validation patterns and identify auto-correction opportunities in the current system. Analyze the gap between the current blocking validation approach and the needed self-correcting approach.

## Objectives
1. Analyze current validation system in role-assignment-validator.md
2. Identify blocking points that could be auto-corrected
3. Research self-correcting validation patterns
4. Map validation failures to auto-correction opportunities
5. Document findings for architecture design

## Research Areas
- Current validation chain implementation
- L3 autonomy requirements for continuous execution
- Auto-correction patterns in similar systems
- Learning integration opportunities
- Git settings enforcement patterns

## Deliverables
- Analysis of current validation system gaps
- List of auto-correction opportunities
- Research findings document
- Recommendations for architecture design

## Acceptance Criteria
- Current validation system thoroughly analyzed
- Auto-correction opportunities identified and documented
- Research findings captured in memory
- Clear path forward for architecture design

## Dependencies
- None (initial research task)

## Knowledge Sources
- src/behaviors/role-assignment-validator.md
- src/behaviors/lean-workflow-executor.md
- Memory search for validation patterns
- Learning system integration patterns
