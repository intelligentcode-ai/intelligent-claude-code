# TASK-072: [AI-Architect] Design Enhanced Auto-Correction Architecture

## Task Details
- **ID**: TASK-072
- **Title**: Design enhanced auto-correction architecture
- **Type**: Architecture
- **Assigned to**: @AI-Architect
- **Effort**: Large
- **Status**: Planned
- **Parent**: BUG-071
- **Dependencies**: TASK-071

## Description
Design a comprehensive architecture for self-correcting validation that automatically fixes validation failures without blocking L3 autonomous execution while maintaining all quality and governance standards.

## Objectives
1. Design auto-correction architecture that maintains quality standards
2. Ensure seamless integration with L3 continuous execution
3. Create transparent logging and learning integration
4. Define correction strategies for different validation failure types
5. Maintain architect approval requirements through automated consultation

## Architecture Requirements
- **Non-blocking**: Never stop L3 autonomous execution
- **Self-correcting**: Automatically fix validation failures
- **Transparent**: Log all corrections for audit and learning
- **Quality-preserving**: Maintain all governance standards
- **Learning-integrated**: Feed corrections into learning system

## Design Areas
1. **Auto-correction Engine**
   - Validation failure detection
   - Correction strategy selection
   - Automatic correction execution
   - Fallback mechanisms

2. **Role Assignment Correction**
   - Capability matching optimization
   - Automatic specialist selection
   - Dynamic specialist creation
   - Architect consultation automation

3. **Git Settings Correction**
   - Privacy enforcement automation
   - Branch protection compliance
   - Commit message cleaning
   - Settings violation auto-fix

4. **L3 Integration**
   - Continuous execution preservation
   - Correction queue management
   - Parallel correction processing
   - Non-blocking correction flow

## Deliverables
- Comprehensive architecture document
- Auto-correction engine design
- Integration specifications
- Correction strategy matrix
- Implementation roadmap

## Acceptance Criteria
- Architecture supports non-blocking auto-correction
- All validation failure types have correction strategies
- L3 continuous execution is preserved
- Quality and governance standards maintained
- Clear implementation path defined

## Review Requirements
- @AI-Architect peer review
- @PM strategic alignment review
- Technical feasibility validation
