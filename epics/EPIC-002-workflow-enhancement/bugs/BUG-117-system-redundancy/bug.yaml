title: Remove system redundancy while preserving all functionality
description: The system has redundant definitions of workflow logic, role operations, and shared patterns across multiple files. This creates maintenance overhead and confusion. Need to consolidate to single sources of truth while maintaining all existing functionality.
priority: P1
severity: high
owner: @PM
tasks:
  - TASK-001  # Create Centralized Workflow Engine
  - TASK-002  # Fix User Interaction Architecture
  - TASK-003  # Consolidate Shared Pattern Files
  - TASK-004  # Validate System Consolidation
reproduction_steps:
  - Review executable-workflow.md (main workflow definition)
  - Check role-assignment-validator.md (redundant workflow logic)
  - Check autonomy-controller.md (redundant autonomy definitions)
  - See duplicated patterns across multiple shared pattern files
acceptance_criteria:
  - Single source of truth for workflow execution
  - Proper user interaction (no direct @Role invocations)
  - Consolidated shared patterns
  - All existing functionality preserved
  - System validation confirms no regression
