# [Developer] Consolidate Shared Pattern Files

**ID:** TASK-003
**Bug:** BUG-117
**Status:** PLANNED
**Assigned:** @Developer
**Priority:** P1

## Description
Merge all shared-patterns/*.md files into a single, well-organized shared-patterns.md file. This consolidation will eliminate redundancy while maintaining all functionality and improving maintainability.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Analyze all existing shared-patterns/*.md files to identify unique vs duplicate content
- [ ] Create unified shared-patterns.md with clear sections for each pattern type
- [ ] Update all imports in behavioral files to reference the consolidated file
- [ ] Remove old pattern files after verification of successful migration
- [ ] Add pattern versioning and documentation for future extensions

## Acceptance Criteria
- Single shared-patterns.md file contains ALL pattern definitions
- No functionality loss during consolidation
- All behavioral files successfully import from consolidated file
- Clear organization with searchable section headers
- Improved performance from reduced file operations

## Technical Notes
- Preserve all existing pattern functionality
- Use consistent naming conventions for patterns
- Group related patterns in logical sections
- Include migration guide for updating imports
- Consider using pattern registry for dynamic lookup
