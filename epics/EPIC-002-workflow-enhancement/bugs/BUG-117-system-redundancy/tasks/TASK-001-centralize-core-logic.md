# [AI-Engineer] Create Centralized Workflow Engine

**ID:** TASK-001
**Bug:** BUG-117
**Status:** PLANNED
**Assigned:** @AI-Engineer
**Priority:** P0

## Description
Create a centralized workflow-engine.md that consolidates all redundant workflow orchestration logic currently scattered across multiple behavioral files. This engine will be the single source of truth for all workflow execution patterns.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Extract core workflow logic from executable-workflow.md into new workflow-engine.md
- [ ] Consolidate role assignment validation logic from multiple files into the engine
- [ ] Implement clean import/delegation pattern for behavioral files to use the engine
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation for all workflow patterns and decision trees
- [ ] Create unit tests for the workflow engine to ensure reliability

## Acceptance Criteria
- Single workflow-engine.md file contains ALL workflow orchestration logic
- No duplicate workflow code remains in any behavioral file
- All behavioral files properly import and delegate to the engine
- Clear separation between orchestration (engine) and behavior (modules)
- Zero functionality loss after consolidation

## Technical Notes
- Use clear section headers for different workflow components
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing behavioral files
- Document all public interfaces clearly
