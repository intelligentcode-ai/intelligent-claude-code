# [QA-Engineer] Validate System Consolidation

**ID:** TASK-004
**Bug:** BUG-117
**Status:** PLANNED
**Assigned:** @QA-Engineer
**Priority:** P1

## Description
Comprehensive testing and validation of the system consolidation to ensure zero functionality loss and improved performance. Create test suites to verify all behavioral patterns work correctly after redundancy removal.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create test cases for all workflow patterns in the new workflow-engine.md
- [ ] Test import chains and verify no circular dependencies exist
- [ ] Performance test to confirm 50% reduction in redundancy
- [ ] Integration test all behavioral files with new consolidated structure
- [ ] Create regression test suite to prevent future redundancy

## Acceptance Criteria
- All existing functionality preserved (100% test coverage)
- Performance metrics show 50% reduction in redundancy
- No circular dependencies detected
- All behavioral files function correctly with new structure
- Automated tests prevent redundancy regression

## Technical Notes
- Use automated testing tools where possible
- Document all test scenarios clearly
- Create performance benchmarks before/after
- Include edge case testing
- Set up continuous monitoring for redundancy
