# BUG-113: ID Tracking Not Properly Applied

## Problem Description
Work item IDs are assigned without checking existing higher-numbered items, causing sequence violations.

## Current Incorrect Behavior
- Used BUG-088 when BUG-109 already existed
- No validation of existing ID sequences
- Manual ID assignment without verification

## Expected Correct Behavior
- Check all existing work item IDs before assignment
- Assign next sequential number in series
- Validate ID uniqueness across project

## Impact Assessment
- **Priority:** P2 (Medium - affects organization)
- **Impact:** Medium - causes ID conflicts and confusion
- **Complexity:** Low - requires ID validation process

## Root Cause
Missing ID validation step in work item creation process
