  BUG: Workflow template files have unnecessary '-corrected' suffix in their names.
  
  CURRENT NAMING:
  - outer-workflow-corrected.yaml
  - inner-workflow-corrected.yaml
  
  EXPECTED NAMING:
  - outer-workflow.yaml
  - inner-workflow.yaml
  
  IMPACT:
  - Confusing naming convention
  - Implies files are corrections rather than standard templates
  - Creates unnecessary complexity in file references
  - Poor naming hygiene

acceptance_criteria:
  - Workflow templates renamed to remove '-corrected' suffix
  - All import references updated to use new names
  - System continues to function with renamed files
  - No broken imports or references
  - Clean, professional naming convention

    imports: 
      - "@../../workflow-templates/outer-workflow-corrected.yaml"
      - "@../../workflow-templates/inner-workflow-corrected.yaml"
  
required_fix:
  - "Rename workflow template files to remove '-corrected' suffix"
  - "Update all import references to use new names"
  - "Validate all imports still work"
  - "Maintain system functionality"
