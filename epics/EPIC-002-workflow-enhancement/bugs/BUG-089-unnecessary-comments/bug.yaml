title: "Unnecessary Comments in Role Behavior Files"
description: |
  Three role behavior files contain unnecessary footer comments:
  - src/behaviors/role-activation-system.md
  - src/behaviors/role-assignment-validator.md  
  - src/behaviors/role-detection-engine.md
  All have: '*Role [X] system for intelligent-claude-code*'
  These add no value and should be removed.
