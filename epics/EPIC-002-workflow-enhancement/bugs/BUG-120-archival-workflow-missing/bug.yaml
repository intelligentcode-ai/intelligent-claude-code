# BUG-120: Archival Process Missing from Workflow

## Problem Description
The executable workflow doesn't include archival of completed bugs/stories. This leads to:
- Completed work cluttering the active workspace
- No systematic archival after MR/PR
- Archive functionality exists but isn't part of workflow
- BUG-117 is complete but still in active bugs directory

## Current State
- Archival process documented in docs/ARCHIVAL-PROCESS.md
- Archive directory exists at epics/EPIC-002-workflow-enhancement/archive/
- Many completed bugs already archived
- But workflow doesn't mandate archival

## Expected Behavior
- Workflow should include archival step after MR/PR
- Completed bugs/stories automatically moved to archive
- Clear trigger point for archival (after merge)
- Maintains clean working directory

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add archival step to outer workflow (after MR/PR)
- [ ] Create behavioral pattern for archival
- [ ] Update workflow documentation
- [ ] Archive BUG-117 as test case
