description: |
  CRITICAL: The behavioral patterns contain PSEUDOCODE which violates the
  fundamental constraint that this is a PURE MARKDOWN behavioral system!
  
  Evidence found:
  - validation-patterns.md contains function definitions with IF/ELSE logic
  - Other shared patterns likely contain similar violations
  - System is mixing code patterns with behavioral patterns
  
  This is a BEHAVIORAL CONFIGURATION SYSTEM - not a coding project!
  All patterns must be pure markdown behavioral descriptions.

impact: "Violates core architectural principle of pure markdown patterns"
