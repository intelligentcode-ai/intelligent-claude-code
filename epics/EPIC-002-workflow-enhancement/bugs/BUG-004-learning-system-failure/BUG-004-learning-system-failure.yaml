title: Learning System Not Capturing Previous Corrections
type: bug
status: COMPLETED
priority: P0
phase: DONE
epic: EPIC-002
created_date: 2025-01-16
severity: CRITICAL
description: >
  The learning-team-automation.md system is not capturing user corrections and preventing 
  repeated errors. Memory system shows empty results despite multiple corrections about 
  QA-Engineer testing limitations and DevOps-Engineer deployment restrictions.

reproduction_steps:
  - User corrects role assignment errors (QA testing, DevOps deployment)
  - System should capture learning entities in memory
  - Memory search returns empty results
  - Same errors repeated in subsequent tasks

expected_behavior:
  - Learning entities created for each correction
  - Memory search returns relevant learnings
  - Future role assignments avoid repeated errors
  - Learning bonuses applied when referencing previous corrections

actual_behavior:
  - Memory system empty despite corrections
  - No learning entities found
  - Same role assignment errors repeated
  - No learning bonuses applied

embedded_config:
  autonomy_level: "L3"
  blocking_enabled: false

notes:
  - Critical P0 bug affecting system learning capability
  - Based on previous learning about QA testing and DevOps deployment restrictions
  - Learning system should prevent repeated role assignment errors
