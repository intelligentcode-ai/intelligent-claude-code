title: "PROJECT-CONTEXT.md Not Considered - Wrong Role Assignments"
description: |
  Teams are NOT reading PROJECT-CONTEXT.md before making role assignments.
  This leads to fundamental misunderstandings about the project nature.
  System is GENERIC for ANY project type, not limited to specific domains.
  Specialist Architects NOT consulted before role assignments.
  PROJECT-CONTEXT.md MUST be enforced as FIRST action in ANY work.

identified_issues:
  - "PROJECT-CONTEXT.md not loaded automatically"
  - "Wrong role assignments due to missing context"
  - "Project scope misunderstood (generic system for ANY project)"
  - "Specialist architects NOT consulted before assignments"
  - "Mandatory triage process ignored"
  - "Role assignment validation bypassed"

root_cause: |
  No enforcement mechanism for PROJECT-CONTEXT.md loading.
  Teams start work without understanding project nature.
  Role assignment happens without context awareness.

impact:
  - Fundamental work done incorrectly
  - Wrong specialists assigned to tasks
  - Project nature violated repeatedly
  - Time wasted on wrong approaches
  - User frustration with repeated corrections

acceptance_criteria:
  - Enforce PROJECT-CONTEXT.md loading FIRST
  - Add to system initialization
  - Validate context understanding
  - Block work without context
  - Auto-correct role assignments
