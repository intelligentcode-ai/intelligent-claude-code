# TASK-002: [AI-Architect] Fix Role Assignment Validation Integration

## Task Details
- **ID**: TASK-002
- **Parent**: BUG-087
- **Title**: [AI-Architect] Fix role assignment validation to use PROJECT-CONTEXT
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Priority**: critical_path
- **Assigned To**: @AI-Architect

## Description
Update the role assignment validation system to require PROJECT-CONTEXT.md understanding before any role assignments. Must enforce specialist architect consultation and prevent wrong role assignments based on project misunderstanding.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Update role-assignment-validator.md
- [x] Add context awareness checks
- [x] Enforce architect consultation
- [x] Block inappropriate assignments
- [x] Add auto-correction patterns

## Subtasks
1. **Context integration** - Add PROJECT-CONTEXT checks to validation
2. **Architect enforcement** - Ensure specialist architects are consulted
3. **Generic system awareness** - Validate roles understand generic nature
4. **Auto-correction patterns** - Fix common misassignments automatically
5. **Error reporting** - Clear feedback on why assignments are blocked

## Dependencies
- TASK-001 (context must be loadable first)

## Notes
- Focus on preventing System-Engineer assignments for AI work
- Emphasize generic nature - not limited to specific domains
- Ensure PM + Architect triage is enforced

## Completion Summary

**@AI-Architect (P:9.5, Q:9.0):** TASK-002 completed successfully.

### Implemented Enhancements

1. **PROJECT-CONTEXT Enforcement**
   - Mandatory context loading before ANY role assignment
   - Context validation chain with blocking for non-compliance
   - Project type awareness ("Behavioral Configuration System")

2. **Context-Aware Work Type Detection**
   - Primary: Behavioral System Work (AI-Engineer required)
   - Secondary: AI/ML, Security, Documentation, Testing
   - Blocked inappropriate roles for behavioral systems

3. **Enhanced Architect Consultation**
   - Mandatory @AI-Architect consultation for ALL specialist work
   - Joint PM + Architect approval requirement
   - Consultation record and decision rationale

4. **Auto-Correction Patterns**
   - System-Engineer → AI-Engineer + AI-Architect consultation
   - DevOps-Engineer → AI-Engineer (for behavioral work)
   - Context mismatch alerts with PROJECT-CONTEXT display

5. **Role Capability Enhancement**
   - Context-aware capability matching (>90% for core work)
   - Clear blocking of inappropriate roles
   - Enhanced command integration (6 new icc: commands)

### Key Behavioral Improvements

- **Context-First Flow**: All validation starts with PROJECT-CONTEXT loading
- **Domain Enforcement**: Prevents infrastructure roles on behavioral work  
- **Auto-Correction**: Smart suggestions with clear blocking messages
- **Generic Awareness**: System understands it works for ANY project type

The role assignment validator now enforces PROJECT-CONTEXT awareness and prevents the critical issue of wrong specialists being assigned to behavioral system work.
