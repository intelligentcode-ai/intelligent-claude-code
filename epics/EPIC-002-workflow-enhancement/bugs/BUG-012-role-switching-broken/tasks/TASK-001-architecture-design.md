# TASK-001 Architecture Design

**Task:** Design role switching mechanism implementation  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Architect  
**Status:** PLANNED  
**Priority:** blocking  
**Dependencies:** none

## Architecture Requirements

### Current Problem
- System mentions @Role assignments but doesn't actually switch
- No behavioral changes occur with role switching
- Roles are discussed but not activated
- System continues as same role despite assignments

### Required Solution
- Actual role switching when @Role is assigned
- Behavioral changes with role assignments
- Role-specific expertise activation
- Multi-role coordination functionality

### Implementation Design

#### Role Activation Mechanism
- Detect @Role notation in task assignments
- Load role-specific expertise and behavior patterns
- Switch active role context and decision-making
- Maintain role state throughout task execution

#### Role State Management
- Track current active role
- Store role-specific context and expertise
- Enable role switching without losing task context
- Support multi-role coordination

#### Behavioral Integration
- Role-specific command patterns
- Expertise-based decision making
- Role-appropriate communication style
- Specialist knowledge activation

## Implementation Plan

1. Design role detection system
2. Create role activation mechanism
3. Implement role state management
4. Add behavioral integration
5. Test role switching functionality
