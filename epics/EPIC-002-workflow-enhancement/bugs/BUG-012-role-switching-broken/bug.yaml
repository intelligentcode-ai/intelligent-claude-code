  CRITICAL BUG: Role switching doesn't actually work in the current system.
  
  CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
  - System mentions "@Role" assignments but doesn't actually switch roles
  - Roles are discussed but not activated
  - No actual role behavior change occurs
  - System continues as same role despite assignments
  
  EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
  - When @Role is assigned, system should become that role
  - Role behavior should actually change with assignments
  - System should adopt the expertise and perspective of the assigned role
  
  IMPACT:
  - Role assignments are meaningless
  - Multi-role coordination doesn't work
  - Team specialization fails
  - System operates as generic AI instead of specialized roles

acceptance_criteria:
  - Role switching actually changes active role and expertise
  - When @Role is assigned, system becomes that role with appropriate behavior
  - Role expertise and perspective changes with assignments
  - System demonstrates role-specific knowledge and decision-making
  - Multi-role coordination works with actual role switching

current_behavior:
  - "@Role assignments discussed but not executed"
  - "System continues as same role despite assignments"
  - "No behavioral changes occur with role switching"
  
required_fix:
  - "Implement actual role switching mechanism"
  - "Change active role behavior based on assignments"
  - "Activate role-specific expertise and decision-making"
