  CRITICAL BUG: Virtual team is losing focus on original scope and task
  execution. Instead of executing assigned tasks, the team is getting
  distracted by meta-work, process discussions, and scope creep.
  
  Observed violations:
  1. Team creating multiple bugs instead of executing original tasks
  2. Focus shifting from task execution to process improvement
  3. Original work items (BUG-065) not being completed
  4. Scope creep through endless bug creation
  5. Team not maintaining focus on assigned objectives
  6. Meta-work taking priority over actual deliverables
  
  This violates the core principle of focused task execution and
  scope management where teams should complete assigned work before
  expanding scope.
  
root_cause: |
  Scope management mechanisms not implemented:
  1. No scope management controls in workflow execution
  2. Team allowed to create unlimited new work items
  3. No focus maintenance mechanisms
  4. Original task execution not prioritized
  5. No scope creep detection and prevention
  6. Meta-work not properly controlled
  
impact: |
  - Original objectives not achieved
  - Team productivity reduced by scope creep
  - Assigned tasks not completed
  - Focus constantly shifting to new work
  - Deliverables not produced
  - Scope management ineffective
