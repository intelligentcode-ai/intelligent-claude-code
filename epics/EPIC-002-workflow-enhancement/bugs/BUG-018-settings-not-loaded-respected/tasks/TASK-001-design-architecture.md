# TASK-001 Design Architecture

**Task:** Design settings loading and application architecture  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Architect  
**Status:** PLANNED  
**Priority:** blocking  

## Design Requirements

### Settings Loading System
- Design mechanism to load config.md on startup
- Define settings structure and validation
- Create settings application framework
- Design git privacy enforcement mechanism

### Architecture Components
1. **Config Loader**
   - Read and parse config.md files
   - Validate settings format
   - Cache loaded settings
   - Provide settings access API

2. **Settings Applicator**
   - Apply settings to system behaviors
   - Enforce git privacy in commits
   - Control autonomy levels (L1/L2/L3)
   - Manage PM activation

3. **Settings Enforcement**
   - Monitor setting compliance
   - Block violations
   - Auto-correct when possible
   - Report violations

## Design Deliverables

- Architecture diagram showing components
- Settings flow from config to application
- Enforcement mechanisms design
- API design for settings access
