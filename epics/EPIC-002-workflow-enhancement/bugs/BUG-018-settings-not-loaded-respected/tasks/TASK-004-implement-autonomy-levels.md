# TASK-004 Implement Autonomy Levels

**Task:** Apply L1/L2/L3 behavior controls  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Engineer  
**Status:** PLANNED  
**Priority:** critical_path  
**Dependencies:** [TASK-002]

## Implementation Requirements

### Autonomy Level Controls
- L1: User approval for all actions
- L2: Architect approval for technical decisions
- L3: Full autonomy with continuous progression

### Implementation Details

```pseudocode
FUNCTION applyAutonomyLevel(action, config):
    SWITCH config.autonomy_level:
        CASE "L1":
            // Require user approval for everything
            RETURN requireUserApproval(action)
            
        CASE "L2":
            // Technical decisions need architect approval
            IF isTechnicalDecision(action):
                RETURN requireArchitectApproval(action)
            ELSE:
                RETURN proceedAutonomously(action)
                
        CASE "L3":
            // Full autonomy - never stop
            RETURN proceedAutonomously(action)
            
    DEFAULT:
        RETURN requireUserApproval(action)

FUNCTION continuousProgression(config):
    IF config.autonomy_level == "L3":
        // Never stop, always continue
        WHILE hasWork():
            nextTask = getNextTask()
            executeTask(nextTask)
            capturelearning(nextTask)
        
        // Even when no work, check periodically
        scheduleNextCheck(5_MINUTES)
```

### Behavioral Changes by Level

**L1 Mode:**
- Stop and ask for approval before each action
- No autonomous decisions
- Full user control

**L2 Mode:**
- Autonomous for routine tasks
- Stop for architecture decisions
- Stop for security decisions
- Continue for implementation

**L3 Mode:**
- Never stop working
- Continuous task execution
- Auto-resolve blockers
- Learn and adapt continuously

## Validation

- L1: System stops and waits for approval
- L2: Only technical decisions require approval
- L3: System continues autonomously
- Settings properly applied throughout
