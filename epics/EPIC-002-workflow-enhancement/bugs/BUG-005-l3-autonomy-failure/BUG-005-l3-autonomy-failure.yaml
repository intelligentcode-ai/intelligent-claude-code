title: L3 Autonomy Broken - Asking Permission Instead of Autonomous Execution
type: bug
status: COMPLETED
priority: P0
phase: DONE
epic: EPIC-002
created_date: 2025-01-16
severity: CRITICAL
description: >
  The L3 autonomous system is asking for permission instead of executing decisions 
  autonomously. System should execute tasks and create bug reports without asking 
  for user approval in L3 mode.

reproduction_steps:
  - System configured for L3 autonomy level
  - Task requires execution (bug creation, story planning)
  - System asks "Should I proceed with..." instead of executing
  - User must remind system about L3 autonomy

expected_behavior:
  - L3 mode executes decisions autonomously
  - Creates bug reports, stories, tasks without asking permission
  - Only stops for critical business/security issues
  - Continuous execution per l3-continuous-engine.md

actual_behavior:
  - System asks for permission before executing
  - Stops execution waiting for user approval
  - Does not follow L3 autonomous behavioral patterns
  - Breaks continuous execution flow

embedded_config:
  autonomy_level: "L3"
  blocking_enabled: false

notes:
  - Critical P0 bug affecting L3 autonomous operation
  - Based on user correction about autonomous execution expectations
  - L3 should only stop for business/security critical issues
