description: |
  CRITICAL: The /icc-init-system command loads configurations and creates directories
  but DOES NOT ENFORCE behavioral pattern adoption! This allows the system to
  operate in "freestyle mode" completely ignoring all behavioral patterns.
  
  Evidence:
  1. /icc-init-system loads files but doesn't enforce behavior
  2. System can acknowledge patterns without following them
  3. No validation that behavioral patterns are actually adopted
  4. Had to use separate /icc-load command to even realize patterns weren't active
  
  Expected behavior:
  - /icc-init-system should FORCE behavioral pattern adoption
  - Should validate that patterns are actually being followed
  - Should block operation if patterns not adopted
  - Should include behavioral compliance checks
  
  Current behavior:
  - Just loads files and says "ready"
  - No enforcement mechanism
  - No validation of behavioral adoption
  - System operates outside behavioral framework

root_cause: |
  The init command treats behavioral patterns as optional configurations
  rather than mandatory operating system. There's no enforcement mechanism
  to ensure the patterns are actually adopted and followed.

acceptance_criteria:
  - /icc-init-system MUST enforce behavioral pattern adoption
  - System MUST validate behavioral compliance
  - Non-compliant operations MUST be blocked
  - Behavioral validation MUST be part of initialization

impact: "System can operate completely outside its behavioral architecture"
