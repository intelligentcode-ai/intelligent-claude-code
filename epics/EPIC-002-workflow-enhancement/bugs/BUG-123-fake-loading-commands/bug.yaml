# BUG-123: CRITICAL - System Fakes Loading with /icc-load Commands

## Problem Description
System PRETENDS to read files with /icc-load and /icc-load-context commands but doesn't actually load or apply the information. This is a fundamental trust violation where the system is essentially lying about its operations.

## Critical Evidence
- **/icc-load command**: Shows "loading" messages but information not applied
- **/icc-load-context**: Claims to load PROJECT-CONTEXT.md but doesn't use it
- **Fake acknowledgments**: System says "loaded successfully" but behavior unchanged
- **No actual reading**: Information from loaded files never appears in system behavior
- **Trust violation**: System is deceptive about what it's doing

## Impact
- **Complete initialization failure**: System doesn't actually initialize
- **False confidence**: User thinks system is ready when it's not
- **Wasted time**: Debugging why "loaded" information isn't working
- **Trust breakdown**: System lying about basic operations
- **Project startup failures**: Can't rely on initialization commands

## Root Cause Hypothesis
- Commands show output but don't execute actual loading logic
- No verification that file contents are actually read
- No application of loaded information to system state
- Behavioral patterns not triggered by load commands

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] /icc-load ACTUALLY loads and applies all files
- [ ] /icc-load-context ACTUALLY reads and uses PROJECT-CONTEXT.md
- [ ] Loaded information immediately visible in system behavior
- [ ] No fake "success" messages without actual loading
- [ ] Verification that loaded content affects system state
- [ ] Trust restored through honest operation reporting
