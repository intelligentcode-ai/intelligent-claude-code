title: "Token Usage Massively Over-Optimized - 441K chars System Bloat"
description: |
  The behavioral system has 441,816 characters across 88 files causing massive
  token inefficiency for AI agent teams. Commands are verbose, behaviors contain
  bloat, and outdated files like TOKEN-OPTIMIZATION-SUMMARY.md exist.
  
  Need aggressive optimization while maintaining 100% functionality for 
  Claude Code virtual team operations.
  
severity: CRITICAL
priority: P0
status: PLANNED
phase: PLAN
workflow_phase: story_creation

identified_issues:
  - "441,816 characters across 88 files - massive bloat"
  - "544 code blocks causing token waste"
  - "Outdated files like TOKEN-OPTIMIZATION-SUMMARY.md still present"
  - "Commands up to 11KB each (icc-plan-tasks.md)"
  - "Memory commands 9-10KB each with excessive JSON examples"
  - "73 example sections with likely duplication"
  - "Verbose behavioral descriptions instead of concise patterns"

root_cause: |
  System grew organically without token optimization focus.
  Behavioral patterns became implementation specifications.
  No systematic approach to token efficiency for AI agents.
  
impact:
  - Claude Code performance degradation
  - Higher token costs for virtual team operations
  - Slower AI agent processing
  - Reduced system efficiency
  - Poor user experience in Claude Code environment

acceptance_criteria:
  - Optimize token usage while preserving 100% functionality
  - Remove outdated bloat files like TOKEN-OPTIMIZATION-SUMMARY.md
  - Streamline commands and behaviors for AI agent consumption
  - Maintain behavioral guidance effectiveness
  - Achieve significant token reduction
  - Keep all virtual team capabilities intact
