# TASK-001: [AI-Engineer] Delete outdated token optimization bloat files

## Task Information
- **ID**: TASK-001
- **Title**: [AI-Engineer] Delete outdated token optimization bloat files
- **Priority**: P0
- **Type**: blocking
- **Parent**: BUG-100 (Token Usage Massively Over-Optimized - 441K chars System Bloat)
- **Assigned to**: @AI-Engineer

## Description
Remove TOKEN-OPTIMIZATION-SUMMARY.md and other outdated optimization files causing bloat in the intelligent-claude-code system. These files contribute to the 441K character bloat and need immediate removal to start the optimization process.

## Parallelization
**No** - This is a blocking task that must complete first before other optimization work can begin safely.

## Subtasks

### 1. Identify all outdated optimization files
- Search for TOKEN-OPTIMIZATION-SUMMARY.md and similar files
- Scan for other optimization artifacts from previous attempts
- Create list of files confirmed as outdated bloat
- Document file locations and sizes for removal confirmation

### 2. Backup files if needed
- Check if any files contain useful patterns or information
- Create backup of potentially useful content before deletion
- Ensure no critical knowledge will be lost
- Document backup rationale and locations

### 3. Delete TOKEN-OPTIMIZATION-SUMMARY.md and confirmed outdated files
- Remove TOKEN-OPTIMIZATION-SUMMARY.md first
- Delete other confirmed outdated optimization files
- Verify files are completely removed from git tracking
- Clean up any references or imports to deleted files

## Dependencies
- None (blocking task)

## Deliverables
- TOKEN-OPTIMIZATION-SUMMARY.md deleted
- Other outdated optimization files removed
- Backup created if needed
- File deletion report with before/after character counts

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TOKEN-OPTIMIZATION-SUMMARY.md completely removed
- [ ] All identified outdated optimization files deleted
- [ ] No broken references to deleted files
- [ ] Character count reduction documented
- [ ] Git history clean of outdated files

## Estimated Effort
1-2 hours

## Notes
This task clears the path for systematic optimization by removing outdated bloat files that interfere with current token optimization efforts.
