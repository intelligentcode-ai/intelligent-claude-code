# TASK-005: [AI-Engineer] Validate virtual team functionality preservation

## Task Information
- **ID**: TASK-005
- **Title**: [AI-Engineer] Validate virtual team functionality preservation
- **Priority**: P0
- **Type**: critical_path
- **Parent**: BUG-100 (Token Usage Massively Over-Optimized - 441K chars System Bloat)
- **Assigned to**: @AI-Engineer

## Description
Ensure 100% functionality maintained after optimization. Comprehensive testing of all @-notation role switching, workflow execution, and Claude Code virtual team operations to verify no capabilities were lost during token optimization.

## Parallelization
**No** - Must validate after all optimization work is complete to ensure comprehensive testing.

## Subtasks

### 1. Test all @-notation role switching
- Verify @PM, @AI-Engineer, @Developer, and all 14 core roles activate correctly
- Test dynamic specialist creation (@React-Developer, @AWS-Engineer, etc.)
- Validate role context switching and behavioral preservation
- Confirm role assignment validation still functions properly

### 2. Verify workflow execution and command integration
- Test outer workflow (epic/story/bug planning) execution
- Verify inner workflow (task execution) operates correctly
- Validate all slash commands (/icc-*) function as expected
- Confirm priority system and scoring integration works

### 3. Validate Claude Code virtual team operations
- Test complete end-to-end virtual team scenarios
- Verify memory integration and learning capture
- Validate git operations and branch management
- Confirm L3 autonomous execution mode functions properly

## Dependencies
- TASK-001 (Delete outdated files) - must complete first
- TASK-003 (Optimize command verbosity) - affects command functionality
- TASK-004 (Consolidate behavioral duplication) - affects behavioral patterns

## Deliverables
- Comprehensive functionality validation report
- Test results for all virtual team capabilities
- Before/after performance comparison
- Any issues discovered and resolved

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All @-notation role switching functions correctly
- [ ] Workflow execution operates without degradation
- [ ] All slash commands work as expected
- [ ] Virtual team operations maintain full capability
- [ ] No functionality lost during optimization

## Estimated Effort
2-3 hours

## Notes
This validation is critical to ensure the token optimization didn't compromise any virtual team capabilities. Must be completed after all optimization tasks to provide comprehensive validation.
