title: "Commands Excessively Verbose - Up to 286 Lines - Token Waste"
description: |
  Commands use VERY EXPRESSIVE language leading to massive files (up to 286 lines).
  This causes excessive token usage for AI-agentic virtual teams.
  Commands should be optimized and shortened WITHOUT losing functionality.
  Focus on AI agent efficiency and token optimization.
  
severity: CRITICAL
priority: P0
status: PLANNED
phase: PLAN

identified_issues:
  - "Commands up to 286 lines long"
  - "VERY EXPRESSIVE language wastes tokens"
  - "Not optimized for AI agent consumption"
  - "Excessive verbosity without functional benefit"
  - "Token costs increase unnecessarily"

root_cause: |
  Commands written for human readability instead of AI efficiency.
  No token optimization considerations.
  Excessive examples and verbose descriptions.

impact:
  - Massive token waste in AI systems
  - Slower AI processing
  - Higher operational costs
  - Reduced system efficiency
  - Poor AI agent experience

acceptance_criteria:
  - Significantly reduce command length
  - Optimize for AI agent consumption
  - Maintain ALL functionality
  - Focus on concise, precise language
  - Achieve token optimization goals
