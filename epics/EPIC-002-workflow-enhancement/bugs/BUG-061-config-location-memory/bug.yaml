problem_description: |
  When users provide configuration file locations (like GitHub PAT location),
  the system fails to store these locations in memory for future reference.
  
  Example: User said "GitHub PAT is in ~/.config/git/common.conf" but
  system didn't create memory entity for this location.
  
root_cause: |
  No pattern for capturing configuration file locations in memory.
  Focus on not storing sensitive values, but forgetting to store paths.
  
impact: |
  - Users must repeatedly provide file locations
  - Inefficient workflow
  - Poor user experience
  - Knowledge not accumulated
