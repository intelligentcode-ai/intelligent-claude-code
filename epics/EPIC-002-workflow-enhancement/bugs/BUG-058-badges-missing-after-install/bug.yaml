problem_description: |
  The /icc-init-system command enforces usage of badges.md for scoring system,
  but src/modes/badges.md file does not exist on client systems after 
  make install or make update. This causes command failures when badges
  are referenced but the file is missing.
  
root_cause: |
  Installation process does not properly deploy badges.md file to client
  systems, but commands expect it to be available.
  
impact: |
  - /icc-init-system command fails when badges.md missing
  - Scoring system cannot function without badges file
  - Installation appears successful but system is broken
