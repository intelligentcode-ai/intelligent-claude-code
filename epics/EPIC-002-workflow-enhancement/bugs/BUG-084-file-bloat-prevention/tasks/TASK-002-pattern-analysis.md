# TASK-002: [System-Engineer] Analyze Current File Creation Patterns

## Overview
**Task ID:** TASK-002
**Title:** [System-Engineer] Analyze Current File Creation Patterns
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Assigned To:** @System-Engineer
**Priority:** P0 (critical_path)
**Type:** research
**Completed:** 2025-01-20

## Description
Analyze current system behaviors and commands to identify file creation patterns causing bloat.

## Subtasks
1. **Scan for file creation behaviors**
   - Identify all Write tool usage patterns
   - Find report/status file generation
   - Locate UPPERCASE filename creation

2. **Analyze problematic patterns**

   - Missing folder organization logic

3. **Document violation sources**
   - Which roles create most bloat
   - Common file types created
   - Root directory pollution sources

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All file creation patterns identified
- [x] Problematic behaviors documented
- [x] Violation sources mapped
- [x] Ready for solution design

## Dependencies
- TASK-001 (need best practices)
