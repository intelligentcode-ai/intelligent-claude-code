title: "File Bloat from Reports/Status Files Without Value"
description: |
  Teams generate excessive report, fix, and status files that provide no value to users.
  Files are created in root directory with UPPERCASE names.
  Documentation is created new instead of enhancing existing docs.
  This creates project mess and confusion.
