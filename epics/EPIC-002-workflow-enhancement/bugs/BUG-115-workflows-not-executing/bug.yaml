# BUG-115: CRITICAL - Inner and Outer Workflows Not Being Executed

## Problem Description
System is completely ignoring workflow templates:
- Outer workflow phases not followed for bug/story handling
- Inner workflow phases not executed for task execution
- No knowledge retrieval, planning, review, or git phases
- Wrong role names used (Developer instead of AI-Engineer)
- Validation chains completely bypassed

## Critical Impact
- **System Integrity:** Core workflow-driven architecture not functioning
- **Quality Loss:** No peer reviews, no knowledge capture, no validation
- **Process Violations:** Every action violates established patterns
- **User Experience:** "THIS BASICALLY KILLS THE SYSTEM!"

## Root Cause Analysis
1. Workflows defined in src/workflow-templates/ but not enforced
2. Behavioral modules not triggering workflow execution
3. Missing integration between workflows and command execution
4. No workflow validation or auto-correction
5. **CRITICAL: Workflows too complex for AI execution**
   - Written as YAML engineering specs not simple steps
   - Full of conditionals and hooks that confuse AI agents
   - Need SIMPLE, CLEAR, EXACT numbered steps

## Evidence
- BUG-087 executed without ANY workflow phases
- Tasks created without proper structure
- No preparatory or closing tasks as mandated
- Role names don't match system definitions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Workflows rewritten as SIMPLE numbered steps
- [ ] Workflows automatically execute for all work items
- [ ] Cannot bypass workflow phases in L3 mode
- [ ] Auto-correction when workflows skipped
- [ ] Proper role names enforced
- [ ] All phases executed in sequence
- [ ] Any AI agent can understand and execute workflows

## Priority Justification
**P0 - CRITICAL**: Without workflows, the entire system architecture fails. This is a complete breakdown of core functionality that was previously working.
