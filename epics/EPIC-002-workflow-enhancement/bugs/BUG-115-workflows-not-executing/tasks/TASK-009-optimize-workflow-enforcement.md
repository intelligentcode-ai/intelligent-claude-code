# TASK-009: [AI-Engineer] Fix workflow-enforcement.md redundancies

## Status: PLANNED
## Priority: P1_redundancy_fix
## SME_Reviewer: @AI-Architect
## Dependencies: TASK-008

## Description
Remove workflow phase redundancies from workflow-enforcement.md and add missing references.

## Subtasks
1. **Remove redundant phase definitions** (lines 24-29)
   - Replace with: "See executable-workflow.md for phase definitions"
   - These duplicate executable-workflow.md exactly

2. **Add command references**
   - Link to /icc-validate-workflow
   - Link to /icc-enforce-workflow
   - Link to /icc-workflow-status

3. **Fix integration references**
   - Properly reference executable-workflow.md
   - Link to Task tool usage patterns

4. **Keep enforcement-specific logic**
   - Maintain all blocking patterns
   - Keep auto-correction behaviors
   - Preserve violation tracking
