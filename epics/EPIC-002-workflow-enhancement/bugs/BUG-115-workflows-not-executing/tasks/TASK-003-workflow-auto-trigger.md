# TASK-003: [AI-Engineer] Create workflow auto-trigger behavioral pattern

## Status: COMPLETED
## Priority: P0_blocking
## SME_Reviewer: @AI-Architect
## Dependencies: TASK-001, TASK-002

## Description
Create a behavioral pattern that automatically detects work starting and triggers the appropriate workflow (outer for story/bug, inner for task).

## Subtasks
1. **Design auto-detection pattern**: Create pattern for detecting STORY/BUG/TASK mentions
2. **Define workflow type selection**: Pattern to identify outer vs inner workflow based on work type
3. **Create enforcement pattern**: Ensure workflow execution when work detected
4. **Add phase state tracking**: Prevent workflow bypass with state enforcement

## Inner Workflow Phases
- [x] Memory Search: Find existing trigger patterns and workflow examples
- [x] Generate Workflow Steps: Design the auto-trigger behavior
- [x] Execute Work: Create workflow-auto-trigger.md behavioral pattern
- [x] SME Peer Review: @AI-Architect reviews pattern design
- [x] Version Bump: Update VERSION file
- [x] Git Operations: Commit with "TASK-003: Create workflow auto-trigger"
- [x] Task Completion: Update status to COMPLETED
- [x] Learning Capture: Store trigger pattern knowledge
