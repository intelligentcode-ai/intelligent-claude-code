# TASK-006: [AI-Engineer] Create workflow detection patterns

## Status: COMPLETED
## Priority: P1_high
## SME_Reviewer: @AI-Architect
## Dependencies: TASK-005

## Description
Create behavioral patterns that detect work item mentions and ensure workflows are followed, preventing skip attempts.

## Subtasks
1. **Design detection patterns**: Define patterns for recognizing work item mentions
2. **Create pre-action validation**: Behavioral rules to check workflow phase before actions
3. **Add auto-correction behaviors**: L3 mode automatic workflow enforcement patterns
4. **Define bypass prevention**: Behavioral patterns that prevent workflow skipping

## Inner Workflow Phases
- [x] Memory Search: Study detection and enforcement patterns
- [x] Generate Workflow Steps: Plan detection approach
- [x] Execute Work: Create workflow detection behaviors
- [x] SME Peer Review: @AI-Architect validates patterns
- [x] Version Bump: Update VERSION file (5.5.4 â†’ 5.5.5)
- [x] Git Operations: Commit with "TASK-006: Add workflow detection patterns"
- [x] Task Completion: Update status to COMPLETED
- [x] Learning Capture: Document detection patterns
