# TASK-010: [AI-Engineer] Optimize remaining behavioral files

## Status: COMPLETED
## Priority: P2_optimization
## SME_Reviewer: @AI-Architect
## Dependencies: TASK-009

## Description
Optimize the remaining behavioral files for conciseness and proper references.

## Subtasks
1. **Optimize workflow-state-tracker.md**
   - Condense three verbose examples to one-line descriptions
   - Remove repetitive state format examples
   - Add /icc-restore-state command reference

2. **Add workflow references to role-management.md**
   - Add "Integration with Executable Workflow" section
   - Reference that @Role triggers Task tool per workflow
   - Link to executable-workflow.md

3. **Fix other missing references**
   - task-creation-mandates.md: Add workflow phase references
   - learning-team-automation.md: Reference workflow retrospective phases
   - config-loader.md: Link to workflow config loading

4. **General cleanup**
   - Remove any pseudo-code comments
   - Consolidate repetitive examples
   - Ensure all files reference executable-workflow.md where relevant

## Inner Workflow Phases
- [x] Memory Search: Review all behavioral files
- [x] Generate Workflow Steps: Plan optimization approach
- [x] Execute Work: Optimize files maintaining functionality
- [x] SME Peer Review: @AI-Architect validates no loss
- [x] Version Bump: Update VERSION file
- [x] Git Operations: Commit with git_privacy=true
- [x] Task Completion: Mark COMPLETED
- [x] Learning Capture: Document optimization patterns

## Completion Notes
Successfully optimized all remaining behavioral files:
- workflow-state-tracker.md: Reduced from 166 to 78 lines (53% reduction)
- role-management.md: Added workflow integration section and removed pseudo-code
- task-creation-mandates.md: Added workflow template import
- learning-team-automation.md: Fixed memory-patterns.md reference
- config-loader.md: Added workflow import and removed pseudo-code
- workflow-enforcement.md: Removed XML example and redundant command section

All behavioral files now properly linked and optimized for clarity without loss of functionality.
