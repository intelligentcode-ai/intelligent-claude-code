# TASK-001: [AI-Architect] Design workflow enforcement mechanism

## Status: PLANNED
## Priority: blocking
## Assigned: @AI-Architect

## Description
Design the architectural approach to enforce outer and inner workflow execution for all work items.

## Subtasks
1. **Rewrite workflows as SIMPLE steps**: Convert YAML specs to numbered AI-executable steps
2. **Design enforcement pattern**: Auto-execution of workflow phases that cannot be bypassed
3. **Integration strategy**: How to integrate simple workflows with lean-workflow-executor.md
4. **Auto-correction design**: What happens when workflows are skipped

## Inner Workflow Phases
- [ ] Knowledge Retrieval: Search existing workflow patterns
- [ ] Task Planning: Design approach 
- [ ] Task Execution: Create architectural design
- [ ] Peer Review: @AI-Engineer review
- [ ] Git Operations: Commit design docs
- [ ] Task Completion: Mark done
- [ ] Knowledge Generation: Capture patterns
