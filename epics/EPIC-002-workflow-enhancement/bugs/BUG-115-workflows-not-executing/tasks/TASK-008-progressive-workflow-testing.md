# TASK-008: [QA-Engineer] Progressive workflow execution testing

## Status: PLANNED  
## Priority: P2
## Assigned: @QA-Engineer
## Dependencies: TASK-007

## Description
Test the progressive enhancement of workflow execution through all three phases (Immediate Simplification, Behavioral Enforcement, Progressive Enhancement). Validate that workflows execute correctly at each phase.

## Subtasks
1. **Phase 1 testing**: Test simplified workflows execute with basic numbered steps
2. **Phase 2 testing**: Validate behavioral enforcement prevents workflow bypassing
3. **Phase 3 testing**: Verify enhanced features like auto-correction and role validation
4. **Integration testing**: Test full end-to-end workflow execution from bug creation to completion

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Phase 1: Simple workflows execute without confusion
- [ ] Phase 2: Cannot bypass workflows - auto-correction works
- [ ] Phase 3: Enhanced features function correctly
- [ ] End-to-end: Complete workflow execution for bugs, stories, and tasks
- [ ] Any AI agent can follow and execute workflows

## Test Scenarios
- Create test bug and verify outer workflow execution
- Create test tasks and verify inner workflow execution  
- Attempt to bypass workflows and verify auto-correction
- Test role assignment validation and workflow triggers
- Validate knowledge retrieval and generation phases

## Inner Workflow Phases
- [ ] Knowledge Retrieval: Study testing patterns and workflow validation approaches
- [ ] Task Planning: Design comprehensive test plan for all three phases
- [ ] Task Execution: Execute tests and document results
- [ ] Peer Review: @System-Engineer validates test coverage and results
- [ ] Git Operations: Commit test documentation and results
- [ ] Task Completion: Update task status
- [ ] Knowledge Generation: Create workflow testing patterns for future use
