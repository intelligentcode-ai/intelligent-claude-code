# TASK-005: [AI-Engineer] Create behavioral workflow enforcement patterns

## Status: PLANNED
## Priority: P0
## Assigned: @AI-Engineer
## Dependencies: TASK-004

## Description
Create behavioral markdown patterns that automatically enforce workflow execution through the behavioral configuration system. Focus on "MANDATORY" and "AUTO-CORRECT" patterns that prevent workflow bypassing.

## Subtasks
1. **Design enforcement headers**: Create "MANDATORY: MUST use workflow execution" headers that trigger auto-correction
2. **Create workflow triggers**: Add behavioral patterns that detect when workflows are being skipped
3. **Add auto-correction logic**: Include instructions that fix workflow violations automatically
4. **Integration patterns**: Connect enforcement with existing behavioral modules like task-creation-mandates.md

## Acceptance Criteria  
- [ ] Workflows include "MANDATORY" behavioral headers
- [ ] Auto-correction patterns for workflow violations
- [ ] Cannot bypass workflow phases - system automatically corrects
- [ ] Works through existing behavioral configuration files
- [ ] No new code required - pure markdown behavioral patterns

## Technical Approach
This is a BEHAVIORAL CONFIGURATION task focusing on markdown instruction patterns, not software engineering. The solution should work through the existing behavioral system that already processes these types of mandatory patterns.

## Inner Workflow Phases
- [ ] Knowledge Retrieval: Study existing enforcement patterns in behavioral modules
- [ ] Task Planning: Design behavioral pattern structure
- [ ] Task Execution: Create enforcement markdown patterns
- [ ] Peer Review: @AI-Architect validates behavioral effectiveness
- [ ] Git Operations: Commit behavioral patterns
- [ ] Task Completion: Mark task complete
- [ ] Knowledge Generation: Document behavioral enforcement patterns
