# TASK-006: [System-Engineer] Integrate workflow validation with behavioral system

## Status: PLANNED
## Priority: P1
## Assigned: @System-Engineer
## Dependencies: TASK-005

## Description
Integrate the simplified workflows and enforcement patterns with the existing behavioral configuration system. Ensure workflows are automatically triggered for all work items through the behavioral pattern system.

## Subtasks
1. **Update behavioral imports**: Modify existing .md files to import the new workflow patterns
2. **Connect enforcement triggers**: Link workflow enforcement with task creation and role assignment patterns
3. **Test behavioral integration**: Verify that behavioral patterns trigger workflow execution
4. **Update system startup**: Ensure workflows are loaded as part of the behavioral configuration system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Workflows automatically execute when starting any work item
- [ ] Behavioral system recognizes workflow violation patterns
- [ ] Auto-correction triggers when workflows are skipped
- [ ] Integration works with existing @-notation role system
- [ ] No manual workflow invocation needed - automatic through behavioral patterns

## Technical Scope
Focus on markdown file imports and behavioral pattern integration. This is configuration management within the behavioral system, not software development.

## Inner Workflow Phases
- [ ] Knowledge Retrieval: Study behavioral import patterns and system integration
- [ ] Task Planning: Map integration points with existing behavioral modules
- [ ] Task Execution: Update import statements and integration patterns
- [ ] Peer Review: @AI-Engineer validates integration effectiveness
- [ ] Git Operations: Commit integration changes
- [ ] Task Completion: Update task status
- [ ] Knowledge Generation: Document integration patterns for future use
