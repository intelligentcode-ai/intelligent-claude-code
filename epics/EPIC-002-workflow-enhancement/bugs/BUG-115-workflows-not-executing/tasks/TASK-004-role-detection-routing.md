# TASK-004: [AI-Engineer] Enhance @Role detection and workflow routing

## Status: COMPLETED
## Priority: P0_critical_path
## SME_Reviewer: @AI-Architect
## Dependencies: TASK-003

## Description
Strengthen @Role pattern detection to ensure all role mentions are intercepted and routed through proper workflow phases.

## Subtasks
1. **Strengthen @Role pattern detection**: Enhance patterns in workflow-enforcement.md
2. **Add workflow validation pattern**: Check workflow active before any role work
3. **Define automatic workflow start**: Pattern to start workflow if not active when @Role detected
4. **Create phase enforcement pattern**: Prevent execution when in wrong workflow phase

## Inner Workflow Phases
- [x] Memory Search: Study current @Role detection patterns
- [x] Generate Workflow Steps: Plan enhancement approach
- [x] Execute Work: Update workflow-enforcement.md with stronger patterns
- [x] SME Peer Review: @AI-Architect validated routing logic
- [x] Version Bump: Update VERSION file from 5.5.1 to 5.5.2
- [x] Git Operations: Commit with "TASK-004: Enhance role detection"
- [x] Task Completion: Update status to COMPLETED
- [x] Learning Capture: Document detection patterns
