# TASK-002: [AI-Engineer] Implement workflow phase execution

## Status: PLANNED
## Priority: critical_path
## Assigned: @AI-Engineer
## Dependencies: TASK-001

## Description
Implement the workflow phase execution mechanism in lean-workflow-executor.md based on architectural design.

## Subtasks
1. **Load workflow templates**: Parse outer-workflow.yaml and inner-workflow.yaml
2. **Phase execution engine**: Implement sequential phase execution with validation
3. **Hook integration**: Support pre/post hooks for extensibility
4. **Auto-correction**: Detect and correct workflow violations

## Inner Workflow Phases
- [ ] Knowledge Retrieval: Study workflow templates and existing patterns
- [ ] Task Planning: Break down implementation approach
- [ ] Task Execution: Code the workflow executor
- [ ] Peer Review: @AI-Architect review implementation
- [ ] Git Operations: Commit implementation
- [ ] Task Completion: Update status
- [ ] Knowledge Generation: Document patterns
