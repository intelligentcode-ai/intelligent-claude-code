# TASK-008: [AI-Engineer] Optimize workflow-auto-trigger.md (highest priority)

## Status: COMPLETED
## Priority: P1_critical_optimization
## SME_Reviewer: @AI-Architect
## Dependencies: TASK-007

## Description
Optimize workflow-auto-trigger.md by removing massive redundancies and improving clarity.

## Subtasks
1. **Remove entire Real-World Examples section** (lines 216-257)
   - These duplicate the patterns already defined above
   - Save 41 lines immediately

2. **Consolidate XML examples**
   - Keep ONE reference example
   - Point to executable-workflow.md for format
   - Reference lines 14-21 of executable-workflow.md

3. **Create concise trigger table**
   - Replace verbose descriptions with table format
   - Pattern | Type | Workflow | Reference

4. **Add missing references**
   - Link to executable-workflow.md
   - Reference /icc- commands
   - Point to Task tool documentation

## Inner Workflow Phases
- [x] Memory Search: Review current files for optimization points
- [x] Generate Workflow Steps: Plan consolidation approach
- [x] Execute Work: Optimize files maintaining functionality
- [x] SME Peer Review: @AI-Architect validates no loss of function
- [x] Version Bump: Update VERSION file
- [x] Git Operations: Commit optimizations
- [x] Task Completion: Mark COMPLETED
- [x] Learning Capture: Document optimization patterns

## Optimization Results
- **Original:** 257 lines
- **Optimized:** 125 lines (51% reduction)
- **Changes:**
  - Removed Real-World Examples section (lines 229-257)
  - Consolidated XML examples to single reference
  - Created concise trigger and workflow tables
  - Added references to executable-workflow.md and commands
  - Maintained ALL critical functionality
  - Improved clarity and reduced token usage

## Learning Captured
- Table formats are more efficient than verbose descriptions
- Single reference examples prevent duplication
- Consolidating related sections improves readability
- Critical functionality can be preserved while reducing bloat by 50%+
