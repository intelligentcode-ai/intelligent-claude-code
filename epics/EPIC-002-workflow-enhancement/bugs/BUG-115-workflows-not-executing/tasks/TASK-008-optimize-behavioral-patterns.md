# TASK-008: [AI-Engineer] Optimize workflow-auto-trigger.md (highest priority)

## Status: IN_PROGRESS
## Priority: P1_critical_optimization
## SME_Reviewer: @AI-Architect
## Dependencies: TASK-007

## Description
Optimize workflow-auto-trigger.md by removing massive redundancies and improving clarity.

## Subtasks
1. **Remove entire Real-World Examples section** (lines 216-257)
   - These duplicate the patterns already defined above
   - Save 41 lines immediately
