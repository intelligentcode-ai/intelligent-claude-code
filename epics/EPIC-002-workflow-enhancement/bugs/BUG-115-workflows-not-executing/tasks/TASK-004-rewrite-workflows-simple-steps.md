# TASK-004: [AI-Engineer] Rewrite workflows as simple numbered AI-executable steps

## Status: PLANNED
## Priority: P0
## Assigned: @AI-Engineer
## Dependencies: TASK-001

## Description
Rewrite the complex workflow templates as SIMPLE numbered steps that any AI agent can understand and execute without confusion. Focus on behavioral configuration patterns rather than technical specifications.

## Subtasks
1. **Simplify outer workflow steps**: Convert 7-step outer workflow from XML specs to simple numbered actions
2. **Simplify inner workflow steps**: Convert 8-step inner workflow from technical descriptions to clear AI instructions  
3. **Remove complexity barriers**: Eliminate conditionals, hooks, and technical jargon that confuse AI execution
4. **Add behavior triggers**: Include clear behavioral triggers like "MUST", "ALWAYS", "AUTO-CORRECT"

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Workflows written as simple 1-2-3 numbered steps
- [ ] No XML, YAML, or technical specifications in workflow steps
- [ ] Each step has clear behavioral instruction (what to do)
- [ ] Any AI agent can read and execute without interpretation
- [ ] Focus on markdown behavioral patterns, not code

## Inner Workflow Phases
- [ ] Knowledge Retrieval: Search for simple workflow patterns in system
- [ ] Task Planning: Plan step-by-step rewrite approach
- [ ] Task Execution: Rewrite workflows as numbered steps
- [ ] Peer Review: @AI-Architect validates simplicity 
- [ ] Git Operations: Commit simplified workflows
- [ ] Task Completion: Update task status
- [ ] Knowledge Generation: Store simplification patterns
