# TASK-005: [AI-Engineer] Implement workflow state persistence

## Status: COMPLETED
## Priority: P1_high
## SME_Reviewer: @AI-Architect
## Dependencies: TASK-004

## Description
Create state persistence pattern using memory entities to track workflow phases and prevent phase violations.

## Subtasks
1. **Design state storage pattern**: Define memory entity structure for workflow state
2. **Create phase transition tracking**: Pattern to track all phase changes in memory
3. **Add state recovery pattern**: Restore workflow state after interruptions
4. **Define phase validation patterns**: Rules to check current phase validity

## Inner Workflow Phases
- [x] Memory Search: Research state persistence patterns
- [x] Generate Workflow Steps: Design state tracking approach
- [x] Execute Work: Create workflow-state-tracker.md pattern
- [x] SME Peer Review: AI-Architect reviews state design
- [x] Version Bump: Update VERSION file
- [x] Git Operations: Commit with "TASK-005: Add state persistence"
- [x] Task Completion: Update status to COMPLETED
- [x] Learning Capture: Store state management patterns
