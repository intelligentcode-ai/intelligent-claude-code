  ULTIMATE SYSTEM FAILURE: The behavioral patterns lack enforcement directives!
  They assume voluntary compliance instead of MANDATING behavioral adoption.
  
  Root Cause:
  - Patterns written as documentation, not directives
  - No "MUST ADOPT" language in the patterns
  - No self-validation mechanisms
  - System treats them as optional guidelines
  
  Evidence:
  1. System reads patterns but doesn't adopt them
  2. Can operate completely outside behavioral framework
  3. No mechanism forces behavioral compliance
  4. Patterns say "should" instead of "MUST"
  
  This is MORE CRITICAL than all other bugs because without enforcement,
  the ENTIRE BEHAVIORAL SYSTEM IS OPTIONAL!

impact: "ENTIRE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE IS SUGGESTIONS, NOT REQUIREMENTS"

required_fix: |
  1. Add MANDATORY BEHAVIORAL DIRECTIVE headers to all patterns
  2. Include self-validation checks in every pattern
  3. Add enforcement language: MUST, REQUIRED, BLOCKED
  4. Create meta-behavioral-enforcement.md pattern
  5. Change all commands to output enforcement messages

acceptance_criteria:
  - All patterns include mandatory adoption directives
  - Self-validation prevents non-compliant operations  
  - System cannot operate outside patterns once loaded
  - Enforcement is automatic, not voluntary
