# TASK-006: [AI-Architect] Design comprehensive enforcement approach

## Objective
Design the enforcement directive system that makes behavioral patterns mandatory rather than optional.

## Subtasks
1. **Define enforcement language** that triggers mandatory adoption
2. **Create auto-correction patterns** instead of blocking
3. **Design validation mechanisms** for compliance checking

## Acceptance Criteria
- Clear enforcement directive template
- Auto-correction approach documented
- Integration points defined

## Priority: P0
## Status: COMPLETED
## Assigned: @AI-Architect
## Dependencies: TASK-005

## Completion Summary

Designed comprehensive enforcement system with:

1. **Standard Enforcement Header** (<100 chars)
   - Format: `**[LEVEL]:** [Core directive]. Auto-correct violations.`
   - Four levels: CRITICAL, MANDATORY, REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED

2. **Auto-Correction Patterns**
   - Fix violations without blocking execution
   - Log corrections for learning
   - Continue normal flow after correction

3. **Enforcement Hierarchy**
   - CRITICAL: System integrity (immediate fix + alert)
   - MANDATORY: Compliance required (fix + penalty)
   - REQUIRED: Best practice (fix + warning)
   - RECOMMENDED: Enhancement (suggestion only)

4. **Implementation Resources Created**
   - `/TASK-006-ENFORCEMENT-DESIGN.md` - Full design document
   - `/src/behaviors/shared-patterns/enforcement-patterns.md` - Reusable patterns

5. **Key Innovations**
   - Token-efficient one-line headers (save 50-100 tokens/file)
   - Auto-correction instead of blocking
   - Shared patterns for consistency
   - Clear command upgrade path ("Use" â†’ "MUST use")
