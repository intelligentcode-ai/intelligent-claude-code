# TASK-001: [AI-Engineer] Add mandatory enforcement directives to behavioral patterns

## Objective
Update all behavioral pattern files to include MANDATORY adoption directives that force behavioral compliance through AUTO-CORRECTION, not stops.

## Subtasks
1. **Add enforcement headers** to all patterns with "MANDATORY BEHAVIORAL DIRECTIVE"
2. **Replace permissive language** ("should", "can") with mandatory ("MUST", "REQUIRED")
3. **Add auto-correction patterns** that fix violations and continue
4. **Include self-validation** checks in each pattern

## Acceptance Criteria
- All patterns start with mandatory adoption directives
- Auto-correction instead of blocking
- Clear enforcement language throughout
- Self-validation mechanisms included
