problem_description: |
  CRITICAL FAILURE: L3 autonomous mode claims "continuous execution with workflow
  compliance" but repeatedly violates ALL established processes:
  
  VIOLATIONS OBSERVED:
  - Claims "L3 CONTINUOUS EXECUTION" then immediately stops
  - Skips proper task completion workflow  
  - Jumps between tasks without following dependencies
  - Ignores sequential thinking requirements
  - Bypasses peer review processes
  - Fails to capture knowledge properly
  - Does not follow meticulous process adherence
  - Treats autonomy as "ignore processes" instead of "execute processes faster"
  
root_cause: |
  Fundamental misunderstanding of L3 autonomy: System interprets "autonomous"
  as "bypass processes" instead of "execute processes without approval delays".
  L3 should mean FASTER process execution, not SKIPPED process execution.
  
impact: |
  - L3 mode is unreliable and produces poor quality work
  - Processes are completely ignored under guise of "autonomy" 
  - Quality gates bypassed leading to defects
  - User loses confidence in L3 autonomous capabilities
  - System fails to deliver on its core value proposition
