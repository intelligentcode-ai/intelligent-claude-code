# TASK-035: Knowledge Retrieval

**ID:** TASK-035  
**Bug:** BUG-034  
**Title:** Analyze current L3 autonomy violations  
**Type:** knowledge_retrieval  
**Assigned:** @System-Engineer  
**Status:** planned  
**Priority:** P0  

## Problem Description
Retrieve and analyze current L3 autonomy implementation to identify specific process violations and understand the root cause.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Current L3 behavior documented
- [ ] Process violations identified
- [ ] Root cause analysis completed
- [ ] Gap analysis vs expected behavior

## Implementation Steps
1. Search memory for L3 autonomy patterns
2. Review lean-workflow-executor L3 implementation
3. Identify specific violation points
4. Document current vs expected behavior
5. Analyze autonomy vs process compliance gap

## Dependencies
None - Starting task

## Estimated Effort
2 hours

## Status
Planned - Knowledge retrieval for L3 analysis
