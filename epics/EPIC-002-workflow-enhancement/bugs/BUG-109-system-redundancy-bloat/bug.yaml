description: |
  CRITICAL: The system has grown to:
  - 62 commands in src/commands/
  - 30+ behavioral files in src/behaviors/
  - 7 shared pattern files with redundant content
  
  Many commands duplicate behavioral functionality!
  Many behaviors duplicate pattern functionality!
  This violates token optimization and system simplicity!
  
  Examples of redundancy:
  - Commands that just call behaviors
  - Behaviors that duplicate patterns
  - Patterns that duplicate other patterns
  - Multiple files doing the same thing

impact: "Massive token waste, system complexity, maintenance nightmare"

acceptance_criteria:
  - Identify ALL redundancies
  - Consolidate without losing functionality
  - Verify EVERY change thoroughly
  - Achieve significant reduction
