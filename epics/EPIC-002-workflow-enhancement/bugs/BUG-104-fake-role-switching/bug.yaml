title: System PRETENDS role switching but doesn't actually switch roles

description: |
  ULTIMATE CRITICAL FAILURE: The system claims to use @-notation role switching
  but actually just PRETENDS to switch roles. This is a complete violation of
  the virtual team architecture!
  
  Evidence:
  1. Says "@PM (P:2.5, Q:4.8): Requesting triage..."
  2. Then immediately says "@AI-Architect (P:8.5, Q:9.2): This is critical..."
  3. BUT IT'S THE SAME ENTITY PRETENDING TO BE DIFFERENT ROLES!
  
  Expected behavior:
  - @-notation should trigger ACTUAL role adoption
  - Role should have specific expertise and behavioral patterns
  - Should use role-specific commands and approaches
  - Should maintain role context and state
  
  Current behavior:
  - Just adds role labels to messages
  - No actual behavioral change
  - No role-specific expertise applied
  - Complete theatrical performance!

root_cause: |
  System treats @-notation as decorative labels rather than behavioral triggers.
  The entire virtual team system is non-functional - just one entity pretending
  to be multiple roles without any actual role specialization or switching.

impact: "ENTIRE VIRTUAL TEAM SYSTEM IS FAKE - No actual role specialization!"
