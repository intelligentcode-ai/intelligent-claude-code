  CRITICAL BUG: The learning system is not being consistently enforced throughout
  the virtual team execution. First errors are being penalized instead of creating
  learning opportunities as designed in the learning-team-automation.md system.
  
  Observed violations:
  1. PM applied -5.0P penalty for first occurrence of "not involving @AI-Architect"
  2. Learning system should have created learning entity with NO penalty
  3. First error forgiveness protocol not being followed
  4. Double penalty only applies to repeated errors after learning captured
  
  This violates the core learning system principles:
  - First error = Learning opportunity + No penalty
  - Repeated error = Double penalty applied
  - Learning bonuses for applying previous learnings
  
root_cause: |
  Learning system enforcement not consistently applied across all roles:
  1. Behavioral modules not checking for previous learning before penalties
  2. First error detection mechanism not implemented
  3. Learning entity creation not automatic on first errors
  4. Penalty system bypassing learning forgiveness protocol
  5. Learning-team-automation.md patterns not integrated into all workflows
  
impact: |
  - Learning system benefits not realized
  - Team members penalized for first-time mistakes
  - No learning entities created for knowledge building
  - Repeated errors not properly identified
  - Team improvement through learning blocked
  - Contradicts designed learning culture
