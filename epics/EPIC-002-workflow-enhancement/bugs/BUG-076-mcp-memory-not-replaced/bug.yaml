title: "MCP Memory Still Used Instead of File-Based System"
description: |
  System still uses MCP Memory throughout instead of the file-based memory
  system that was supposed to replace it entirely.
  
severity: HIGH
priority: P1
status: PLANNED
phase: PLAN

identified_issues:
  - "MCP Memory calls throughout behaviors"
  - "File-based memory system not implemented"
  - "Memory operations dependent on MCP"
  - "Architecture decision not followed"

root_cause: |
  File-based memory system was specified but never implemented to replace
  MCP Memory integration.

impact:
  - Dependency on external MCP system
  - Memory operations may fail
  - Architecture inconsistency

acceptance_criteria:
  - Design file-based memory system
  - Replace ALL MCP Memory calls
  - Implement file-based storage
  - Validate memory operations work
