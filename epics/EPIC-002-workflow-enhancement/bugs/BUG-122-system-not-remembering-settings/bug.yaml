# BUG-122: CRITICAL - System Does Not Apply and Remember Information Given

## Problem Description
System repeatedly fails to remember and apply critical settings and information, requiring DOZENS of reminders for the same information. This affects ALL projects and is a fundamental system failure.

## Critical Evidence
- **git_privacy setting**: Despite being set to true, system repeatedly tries to add AI mentions to commits
- **Workspace information**: System forgets working directory and project context
- **Settings from CLAUDE.md**: Information clearly present gets ignored
- **PROJECT-CONTEXT.md**: Fundamental project information not retained
- **Repeated violations**: Same errors occur dozens of times in single session

## Impact
- **User frustration**: Having to remind system of same information repeatedly
- **Workflow disruption**: Constant corrections break flow
- **Trust erosion**: System appears unreliable when it can't remember basics
- **Efficiency loss**: Time wasted on repeated corrections

## Root Cause Hypothesis
- Information loaded but not properly propagated to subagents
- Settings not persisted across Task tool invocations
- No validation that loaded information is actually applied
- Behavioral patterns not enforcing setting compliance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System remembers ALL settings throughout entire session
- [ ] Settings properly propagate to ALL subagents
- [ ] No repeated violations of known settings
- [ ] Validation that loaded information is applied
- [ ] Persistent enforcement of critical settings like git_privacy
