  CRITICAL BUG: Roles are acting like humans instead of executing their defined
  behavioral patterns. This violates the virtual team architecture where roles
  should be autonomous behavioral agents, not human-like entities.
  
  Observed violations:
  1. PM "awaiting joint planning sessions" instead of delegating
  2. Roles asking for confirmation instead of executing autonomously
  3. Roles "waiting" for other roles instead of coordinating
  4. Human-like communication patterns instead of role-specific behaviors
  5. Roles not following their defined behavioral patterns
  6. Lack of autonomous decision-making within role constraints
  
  This violates the core virtual team principles where roles should execute
  their behavioral patterns autonomously with proper coordination.
  
root_cause: |
  Role behavioral patterns not properly implemented:
  1. Role activation doesn't enforce behavioral patterns
  2. No autonomous decision-making within role constraints
  3. Human-like communication patterns instead of role-specific
  4. Roles not following their defined responsibilities
  5. Lack of proper role behavior enforcement
  6. No behavioral pattern validation during role execution
  
impact: |
  - Roles behave like humans instead of specialized agents
  - Virtual team benefits not realized
  - No autonomous execution within role constraints
  - Communication patterns inconsistent with role definitions
  - Behavioral patterns not enforced
  - Team coordination ineffective
