# TASK-010: [AI-Engineer] Create Behavioral Learning Patterns

## Overview
**Task ID:** TASK-010
**Title:** [AI-Engineer] Create Behavioral Learning Patterns
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Assigned To:** @AI-Engineer
**Priority:** P0 (optional)
**Type:** knowledge_creation
**Completed:** 2025-01-19

## Description
Capture learnings about command parameter behavioral patterns for future reference and system improvement.

## Subtasks
1. **Document parameter pattern learnings**
   - What parameter formats work for AI
   - Common interpretation mistakes
   - Best practices discovered

2. **Create reusable patterns**
   - Template for future commands
   - Behavioral pattern library
   - AI interpretation guidelines

3. **Store learnings for team**
   - Create learning documents
   - Update pattern library
   - Share with virtual team

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Learnings documented (command-design-patterns.md created)
- [x] Patterns extracted ($ARGUMENTS pattern, error handling, command chaining)
- [x] Knowledge stored for reuse (3 memory entities created)
- [x] Team can access learnings (memory relationships established)

## Dependencies
- All other tasks complete

## Parallel Execution
- Can extract different learning types in parallel

## Output
- Learning document: `../learnings/command-design-patterns.md`
- Pattern library additions: CommandPattern-ArgumentParsing entity
- Behavioral guidelines: $ARGUMENTS usage mandatory
- Team knowledge base updated: 3 memory entities with relationships

## Completion Notes
**Critical Discovery**: The $ARGUMENTS parameter is the ONLY way slash commands receive input. Named parameters in command functions receive no values. This discovery resolved system-wide command failures in BUG-073.

**Key Deliverables**:
1. Created comprehensive learning document at `../learnings/command-design-patterns.md`
2. Stored 3 memory entities:
   - Learning-CommandDesign-ARGUMENTS-2025-01-19
   - CommandPattern-ArgumentParsing  
   - Learning-CommandFailure-Prevention
3. Established relationships to BUG-073 and affected commands
4. Documented prevention strategies and testing patterns

**Impact**: All future commands MUST use $ARGUMENTS pattern or they will silently fail.
