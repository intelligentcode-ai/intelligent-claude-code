title: "All Commands Use Incorrect Parameter Scheme - System Non-Functional"
description: |
  ALL slash commands use incorrect parameter format for Claude Code, making the entire 
  command system non-functional. This is the MOST CRITICAL issue as nothing can execute.
  
  CRITICAL CONTEXT:
  - This is a MARKDOWN-based behavioral system for AI agents
  - NOT executable code - behavioral patterns only
  - Work ONLY in src/ directory
  - NO testing possible - only deployment activation
  - Deployment by USER only
  - Commands are markdown files that guide AI behavior
  
severity: CRITICAL
priority: P0
status: IN PROGRESS
phase: EXECUTE

identified_issues:
  - "ALL commands use wrong parameter scheme"
  - "Parameters not compatible with Claude Code"
  - "Commands cannot execute at all"
  - "No research done on proper format"

root_cause: |
  Command parameter format was never researched or validated against Claude Code's
  actual requirements.

impact:
  - ENTIRE SYSTEM NON-FUNCTIONAL
  - No commands can execute
  - Virtual team cannot operate

acceptance_criteria:
  - Research correct Claude Code parameter format
  - Update ALL commands to use correct format
  - Verify each command executes properly
