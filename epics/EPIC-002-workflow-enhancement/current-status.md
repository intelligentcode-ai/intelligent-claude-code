# EPIC-002 Current Status

## Critical Issues Identified

### P0 Priority (Critical - Must Fix Now)
1. **BUG-002**: System bloat - Both old and new systems active
   - No role switching happening
   - No workflow execution occurring
   - System completely confused

2. **STORY-005**: No priority system
   - Last item treated as highest priority (wrong!)
   - No way to execute critical work first
   - Conceptually backwards

3. **STORY-006**: Wrong terminology throughout
   - "Tasks" are actually stories
   - "Subtasks" are actually tasks
   - Missing epic structure

### P1 Priority (High - Fix Next)
1. **BUG-003**: Commands missing icc: prefix
   - New commands don't follow convention
   - Inconsistent with existing system

2. **STORY-004**: Need lean behavioral system
   - Current system too complex
   - Not actually executing

### P2 Priority (Medium - Normal Flow)
1. **STORY-001**: REFINE vs NEW handling
2. **STORY-002**: Process modularization
3. **STORY-003**: Task completion enforcement

## Immediate Action Required

The system is currently NON-FUNCTIONAL because:
- Old behavioral system interferes with new approach
- No actual role switching or workflow execution
- Wrong terminology prevents proper understanding
- No priority system means wrong execution order

## Next Steps

As @PM, I need to:
1. Plan the P0 items first (BUG-002, STORY-005, STORY-006)
2. Break them into proper tasks
3. Assign to appropriate specialists
4. Execute in priority order

The system needs immediate surgery to remove the bloat and implement core functionality correctly.
