# TASK-007 Update Documentation - COMPLETE

**Task:** Update Documentation  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Engineer  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 12:15:00

## Documentation Updates Summary

Updated CLAUDE.md to accurately reflect the lean workflow architecture migration from complex behavioral enforcement to assignment-driven execution.

## Changes Made

### Core Architecture Documentation
**Before:** Complex behavioral enforcement with 19 modules
**After:** Lean workflow architecture with 6 components

### Updated Source Directory Structure
```markdown
OLD:
- modes/core-systems.md - Complex enforcement
- modes/execution-engine.md - Penalties, monitoring
- modes/role-framework.md - 14 core roles with enforcement
- modes/integration-layer.md - Memory coordination
- modes/operational-protocols.md - Git enforcement
- behaviors/ - 13+ enforcement modules

NEW:
- modes/virtual-team.md - LEAN virtual team mode
- modes/badges.md - Scoring system
- roles/specialists.md - Clean role definitions
- behaviors/lean-workflow-executor.md - CORE workflow engine
- behaviors/learning-team-automation.md - Learning capture
```

### Updated Architecture Description
**Replaced:** Complex pseudo-code enforcement patterns
**With:** Lean workflow architecture features:
- Assignment-driven execution
- Validation command chains
- Role assignment validation
- File-based workflows
- Quality gates via peer review

### Updated Core Components
**Added:** 
- Assignment files (epic.yaml, story.yaml) with embedded config
- Validation command chains for governance
- Scoring system via badges.md
- Learning system via learning-team-automation.md

**Removed references to:**
- Complex behavioral enforcement
- Monitoring loops
- Penalty systems
- Auto-correction patterns

### Updated Extension Points
**Changed:**
- Roles: `src/modes/role-framework.md` → `src/roles/specialists.md`
- Behaviors: `src/behaviors/` modules → `src/behaviors/lean-workflow-executor.md`
- Commands: `src/commands/` directory → `workflow-templates/` directory

### Updated Development Tasks
**Modified common tasks:**
- Adding roles: Now edit specialists.md instead of role-framework.md
- Modifying behaviors: Now edit lean-workflow-executor.md instead of multiple enforcement modules
- Configuration: Focus on assignment files and validation chains

### Updated Design Constraints
**Changed:**
- "Command chain mandatory enforcement" → "Validation command chains for governance"
- "Quality gates for all completions" → "Quality gates via peer review by SMEs"
- Added: "Assignment file-driven execution"

## Benefits of Documentation Update

### Accuracy
✅ **Reflects Current Architecture:** Documentation now matches actual lean system implementation
✅ **Removes Outdated References:** No more references to deleted enforcement modules
✅ **Correct File Paths:** All paths point to existing files in new structure

### Clarity
✅ **Clear Architecture Description:** Lean workflow approach clearly explained
✅ **Simplified Component List:** 6 components instead of 19+ complex modules
✅ **Focused Development Guide:** Clear guidance for extending lean system

### Maintainability
✅ **Easier Onboarding:** New developers can understand system more quickly
✅ **Correct Extension Points:** Clear guidance on where to add new functionality
✅ **Accurate Troubleshooting:** Documentation matches actual system behavior

## Validation

### Documentation Accuracy Check
- ✅ All referenced files exist in new lean architecture
- ✅ All component descriptions match actual implementation
- ✅ All development tasks reference correct file locations
- ✅ All design constraints reflect current system behavior

### Completeness Check
- ✅ Core architecture changes documented
- ✅ Component structure updated
- ✅ Extension points corrected
- ✅ Development workflows updated
- ✅ Design constraints aligned

## Impact Assessment

### Developer Experience
- **Improved:** Simpler architecture easier to understand and extend
- **Streamlined:** Clear development tasks with correct file references
- **Accurate:** Documentation matches actual system implementation

### System Understanding
- **Clearer:** Lean workflow approach vs complex enforcement
- **Focused:** 6 components vs 19+ modules to learn
- **Practical:** Assignment-driven execution model clearly explained
