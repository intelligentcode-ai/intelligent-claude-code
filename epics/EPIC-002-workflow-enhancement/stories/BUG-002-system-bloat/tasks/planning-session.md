# BUG-002 Planning Session

**Bug:** System Bloat - Old and New Systems Active  
**Planning by:** @PM  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 10:00:00  
**Workflow:** outer-workflow-corrected.yaml

## Phase 1: Knowledge Retrieval
- Similar system cleanups: Remove conflicting systems first
- Architecture patterns: Single responsibility principle
- Deployment patterns: Blue-green for major changes

## Phase 2: Requirements Analysis
**Problem:** Both old behavioral system and new lean system active simultaneously
**Impact:** No role switching, no workflow execution, complete confusion
**Urgency:** P0 - System non-functional

## Phase 3: Architecture Design
**Approach:** Clean removal of old system, activate lean system only
**Risk:** Breaking existing functionality during transition
**Mitigation:** Careful component-by-component removal
