# TASK-002 Remove Old Behavioral Modules - COMPLETE

**Task:** Remove Old Behavioral Modules  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Engineer  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 11:25:00

## Implementation Summary

Successfully removed 13 complex enforcement modules and created lean role definitions system.

## Files Created

### New Lean Role System
```
CREATED:
└── src/roles/specialists.md      ✅ CREATED - Clean role definitions only
```

## Current System State

### Remaining Files (Lean System)
```
KEPT:
├── src/modes/
│   ├── badges.md                 # Scoring system (per user requirement)
│   └── virtual-team.md           # Needs import update (TASK-003)
├── src/behaviors/
│   ├── lean-workflow-executor.md # Simple executor
│   └── learning-team-automation.md # Learning system (per user requirement)
└── src/roles/
    └── specialists.md            # Clean role definitions
```

## What Was Accomplished

✅ **13 complex enforcement files removed**  
✅ **Role definitions extracted to clean specialists.md**  
✅ **Scoring and learning systems preserved** (per user requirement)  
✅ **Lean workflow executor preserved**  
✅ **System simplified from 19 modules to 6 components**

## System Reduction

- **Before:** 19 complex behavioral modules with enforcement
- **After:** 6 lean components (role definitions + executor + scoring + learning + workflows)
- **Reduction:** ~68% reduction in system complexity

## Next Step

Hand off to @System-Engineer for TASK-003: Update Virtual Team Imports to use only the 6 lean components.

## Validation

The remaining files represent the lean architecture:
1. **specialists.md** - Role definitions without enforcement
2. **lean-workflow-executor.md** - Simple file-based execution
3. **learning-team-automation.md** - Learning capture (preserved per user)
4. **badges.md** - Scoring system (preserved per user)
5. **workflow-templates/*.yaml** - Workflow definitions (existing)

No more complex enforcement, monitoring loops, or penalty systems interfering with workflow execution.
