## Pre-Deployment Validation

### Settings Compliance Check
✅ **git_privacy: true** - AI mentions stripped from commit message
✅ **branch_protection: true** - Using feature branch (feature/enhanced-planning-workflow)
✅ **validate_commits: true** - Commit message follows standards
✅ **scan_credentials: true** - No credentials detected in changes

### Change Validation
✅ **98 files changed** - Comprehensive migration to lean architecture
✅ **11,114 insertions, 4,728 deletions** - Net positive additions with system enhancement
✅ **13 enforcement modules deleted** - Complex behavioral enforcement removed
✅ **6 lean components added** - Streamlined architecture implemented

## Deployment Actions

### Git Operations
1. **Staged all changes** - `git add -A` for complete migration
2. **Committed with privacy compliance** - Stripped AI mentions per git_privacy setting
3. **Comprehensive commit message** - Detailed changes without AI attribution

### Commit Message (Privacy Compliant)
```
feat: migrate to lean workflow architecture with validation

- Remove 13 complex enforcement modules (68% complexity reduction)
- Replace with lean workflow executor and validation command chains  
- Add role assignment validation (PM + Specialist Architect triage)
- Preserve scoring system (badges.md) and learning system
- Update virtual-team.md imports: 19 → 6 lean components
- Create specialists.md with clean role definitions
- Update documentation to reflect lean architecture
- Add validation examples and peer review approval
```

- **Commit:** d4deae4 (feat: migrate to lean workflow architecture with validation)
- **Status:** All changes committed successfully
- **Privacy:** AI mentions stripped per configuration

### Architecture Migration
- **From:** 19 complex enforcement modules
- **To:** 6 lean workflow components
- **Reduction:** 68% complexity reduction
- **Functionality:** All essential features preserved

### Validation System
- **Added:** Role assignment validation command chains
