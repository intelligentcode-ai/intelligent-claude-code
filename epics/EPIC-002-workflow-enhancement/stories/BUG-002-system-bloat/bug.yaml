  reported_by: "@User"

  assigned_to: "@PM"
  severity: "CRITICAL"
  priority: "P0"  # System is confused and not functioning
  status: "TRIAGED"
  phase: "EXECUTE"
  
bug_description: |
  The system has both old behavioral enforcement AND new lean workflow active
  simultaneously, causing confusion and preventing proper execution. No role
  changes are happening, no workflow execution is occurring.
  
reproduction_steps:
  - Try to execute any workflow
  - Observe: Old behavioral system interferes
  - Notice: Roles don't actually switch
  - See: Workflows don't execute
  
expected_behavior: |
  Only lean workflow executor should be active
  Roles should switch based on @-notation
  Workflows should execute based on assignment files
  
actual_behavior: |
  Both systems active causing interference
  No role switching occurs
  No workflow execution happens
  
impact_analysis:
  affected_users: "All users"
  frequency: "Always"
  business_impact: "System non-functional"
  workaround: "None"
  
root_cause_analysis: |
  Migration incomplete - old system not deactivated
  New system not properly integrated
  Role switching mechanism not connected
  
resolution_criteria:
  - Old behavioral system completely removed
  - Lean workflow executor active
  - Role switching works per @-notation
  - Workflows execute based on assignment files
  - Commands use proper icc: prefix
  
embedded_config:
  # ALL settings from config.md
  autonomy_level: "L3"
  pm_always_active: true
  memory_integration: true
  blocking_enabled: false
  git_privacy: true
  # All other settings needed during execution
  
affected_components:
  old_system:
    - "src/modes/*.md"  # Complex behavioral modules
    - "src/behaviors/*.md"  # Enforcement patterns (except lean-workflow-executor)
    - "src/commands.md"  # Old command chains
  new_system:
    - "src/behaviors/lean-workflow-executor.md"  # Keep this
    - "workflow-templates/*.yaml"  # Workflow definitions
    - "templates/*-assignment-template.yaml"  # Assignment templates
    
virtual_team_update_needed:
  current_imports: |
    @modes/core-systems.md
    @modes/execution-engine.md
    @modes/role-framework.md
    @modes/integration-layer.md
    @modes/operational-protocols.md
    @behaviors/*.md  # TOO MANY!
  
  should_be: |
    @src/roles/specialists.md  # Role definitions only
    @src/behaviors/lean-workflow-executor.md  # Single executor
    @workflow-templates/outer-workflow.yaml
    @workflow-templates/inner-workflow.yaml
    
technical_details:
  - Remove all penalty systems
  - Remove monitoring loops
  - Remove command chains
  - Keep only role definitions
  - Keep only lean executor
  - Ensure @-notation triggers role switch
  - Ensure workflows read assignment files
