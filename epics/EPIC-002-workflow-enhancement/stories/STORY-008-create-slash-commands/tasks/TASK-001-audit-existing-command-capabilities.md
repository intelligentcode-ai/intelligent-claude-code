# TASK-001: Audit Existing Command Capabilities

**ID:** TASK-001  
**Story:** STORY-008  
**Title:** Audit existing command capabilities in current system  
**Type:** research  
**Assigned:** @AI-Architect  
**Status:** completed  
**Priority:** P0  

## Problem Description
Need to analyze current system capabilities from lean-workflow-executor and behavioral modules to identify what functions should become icc: slash commands.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All existing icc: functions catalogued from behavioral modules
- [x] Current system capabilities documented
- [x] Legacy command patterns identified and marked for deprecation
- [x] Integration points with lean-workflow-executor mapped
- [x] Command feasibility assessment completed

## Implementation Steps
1. ✅ Scan src/behaviors/*.md for existing icc: functions
2. ✅ Review lean-workflow-executor validation chains
3. ✅ Identify PM command system capabilities
4. ✅ Document archival-intelligence commands
5. ✅ Map role-activation-system functions
6. ✅ Create capability matrix for command creation

## Deliverables
- ✅ Command capability audit report
- ✅ Function-to-command mapping
- ✅ Integration requirements documentation

## Dependencies
None

## Estimated Hours
2 hours

## Completion Notes
✅ **COMPLETED** - Identified existing system functions suitable for slash commands
✅ Found validation chains, archival functions, role activation capabilities
✅ Documented integration points with current behavioral modules
