problem_description: |
  The system contains powerful functions in behavioral modules that should be
  accessible as Claude Code slash commands for reliable execution. Need to
  transform key system functions into icc: prefixed slash commands and create
  proper .claude/commands/ directory structure for Claude Code integration.
