problem_statement: |
  The system lacks a formal findings protocol that enforces workflow restart 
  when discoveries are made during process execution. The change request requires:
  
  1. Bonus points for discovering role
  2. New bugs/tasks creation within current work-item
  3. Complete workflow restart (peer-reviews, documentation, DoD, deployment, tests, git)
  4. 5x WTF penalty for any deviations
  
  This protocol must be integrated into the src-system behavioral framework
  to ensure consistent enforcement across all workflow executions.
  
user_story: |
  As a virtual team member executing tasks, I want a formal findings protocol
  that automatically rewards discoveries, creates follow-up work, and restarts
  the complete workflow chain, so that all findings are properly processed
  and no shortcuts are taken in the workflow execution.
  
business_value: |
  - Ensures thorough process execution without shortcuts
  - Rewards team members for discovering issues
  - Maintains workflow integrity through complete restart cycles
  - Prevents deviations with strong penalty enforcement
  - Standardizes findings handling across all work items
