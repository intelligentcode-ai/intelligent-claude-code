# TASK-001 Design Archival System Architecture

**Task:** Design archival system architecture  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Architect  
**Status:** COMPLETED ✅  
**Priority:** blocking  

## Requirements

Design a comprehensive archival system that:
1. Automatically detects completed bugs/stories
2. Separates completed tasks from version control
3. Preserves completed bugs/stories in version control
4. Maintains clean working directory
5. Provides restoration capabilities

## Architecture Components

### 1. Detection System
- Monitor bug/story status changes
- Identify completed items
- Trigger archival workflow

### 2. Archival Engine
- Move completed tasks to archives/tasks/
- Move completed bugs/stories to archives/completed/
- Update .gitignore appropriately
- Handle git operations

### 3. Command System
```bash
icc:archive-completed     # Archive all completed items
icc:archive-bug BUG-XXX  # Archive specific bug
icc:archive-story STORY-XXX # Archive specific story
icc:restore-archived ITEM-XXX # Restore archived item
```

### 4. Integration Points
- Lean workflow executor hooks
- PM command system integration
- Git operations coordination
- Status monitoring

## Directory Structure
```
archives/
├── completed/          # Version controlled
│   └── EPIC-XXX/
│       ├── BUG-XXX/
│       └── STORY-XXX/
└── tasks/             # NOT version controlled
    └── EPIC-XXX/
        ├── BUG-XXX/
        └── STORY-XXX/
```

## Success Criteria

- Clear separation of concerns
- Automated detection and archival
- Safe git operations
- Restoration capability
- Integration with existing systems
