# TASK-002 Implement Archival Detection Logic

**Task:** Implement archival detection logic  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Engineer  
**Status:** COMPLETED âœ…  
**Priority:** critical_path  
**Dependencies:** [TASK-001]

## Implementation Requirements

Implement the AI-driven detection logic for identifying completed items ready for archival.

### Detection Criteria
- Items with status: "COMPLETED" and phase: "ARCHIVED"
- Minimum 24-hour aging period after completion
- No active references or dependencies
- All associated tasks completed

### Implementation Components

1. **Completion Scanner**
   - Scan all epics/bugs/stories
   - Check status and phase fields
   - Validate completion date

2. **Aging Validator**
   - Calculate time since completion
   - Enforce 24-hour minimum
   - Allow configuration override

3. **Dependency Checker**
   - Check for active references
   - Validate no blocking dependencies
   - Ensure safe to archive

4. **Task Completeness**
   - Verify all child tasks completed
   - No in-progress work items
   - Clean completion state

## Files to Create/Update

- src/behaviors/archival-intelligence.md - Core detection logic
- Integration with lean-workflow-executor.md
- Hook into completion events

## Success Criteria

- Accurate detection of completed items
- Respects aging requirements
- Safe dependency validation
- Integration with workflow events
