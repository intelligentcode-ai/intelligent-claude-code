# TASK-006 Update Documentation with Validation Process - COMPLETE

**Task:** Update Documentation with Validation Process  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Engineer  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 12:45:00

## Documentation Updates Summary

Successfully updated CLAUDE.md to include comprehensive documentation of the role assignment validation system, ensuring developers understand validation processes and integration patterns.

## Changes Made to CLAUDE.md

### 1. Updated File Editing Patterns
**Before:**
```markdown
- **Roles**: Edit `src/modes/role-framework.md`
- **Behavioral Pseudo-Code**: Edit files in `src/behaviors/` with hybrid approach
```

**After:**
```markdown
- **Roles**: Edit `src/roles/specialists.md`
- **Workflow Engine**: Edit `src/behaviors/lean-workflow-executor.md`
- **Workflow Templates**: Edit `workflow-templates/outer-workflow-corrected.yaml` and `inner-workflow-corrected.yaml`
```

### 2. Enhanced Command Chain Patterns
**Added:**
```bash
# Role assignment validation
icc:detect-work-type → icc:require-triage → icc:validate-assignments → icc:require-approval
```

### 3. Updated Role Coordination Section
**Added:**
```markdown
- **Role Assignment Validation**: Mandatory PM + Specialist Architect triage for all assignments
```

### 4. Comprehensive Role Assignment Validation System Documentation

#### Added Complete Validation System Section
```markdown
### Role Assignment Validation System
- **Automatic Work Type Detection**: AI-agentic, infrastructure, and domain-specific work detection
- **Mandatory Triage**: PM + Specialist Architect approval required for all assignments
- **Capability Matching**: >70% capability match enforced with specialist preference
- **Error Prevention**: Prevents wrong specialist assignments and meaningless busywork
- **Workflow Integration**: Validation gates integrated into planning and execution phases
- **Security Requirements**: Automatic security review requirements for architecture changes
```

#### Added Validation Command Chains Documentation
```bash
# Work type detection
icc:detect-work-type(content) → specialist_architect_type

# Mandatory triage process
icc:require-triage(pm_role, specialist_architect) → triage_complete

# Assignment validation
icc:validate-assignments(task, proposed_role) → validation_result

# Joint approval gate
icc:require-approval(pm_role, specialist_architect) → approval_granted
```

#### Added Assignment Rules Documentation
```markdown
- **AI-agentic work** → @AI-Architect or @AI-Engineer required
- **Infrastructure work** → @System-Engineer or @DevOps-Engineer required
- **Peer reviews** → Domain expert SMEs only
- **Security reviews** → @Security-Engineer for architecture changes
- **Capability match** → >70% match required for all assignments
```

## Validation Process Documentation

### 1. Planning Phase Validation
```markdown
Planning Phase:
1. Task identified → icc:detect-work-type(task_content)
2. Work type detected → icc:require-triage(pm_role, specialist_architect)
3. Triage complete → icc:validate-assignments(task, proposed_role)
4. Validation passed → icc:require-approval(pm_role, specialist_architect)
5. Approval granted → Assignment created
```

### 2. Execution Phase Validation
```markdown
Execution Phase:
1. Peer review needed → icc:detect-work-type(task_content)
2. Work type detected → icc:validate-assignments(review_task, proposed_reviewer)
3. Validation passed → Reviewer assigned
4. Review completed → Task validation continues
```

### 3. Error Prevention Documentation
```markdown
Error Prevention:
- Generic architect used → System requires specialist architect
- Wrong specialist assigned → System enforces capability matching
- Missing security review → System automatically adds security validation
- Meaningless tasks → Triage process validates business value
```
