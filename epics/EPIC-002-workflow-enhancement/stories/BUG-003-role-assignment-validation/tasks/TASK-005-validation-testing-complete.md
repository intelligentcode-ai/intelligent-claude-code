EXPECTED: validation_failed = true (generic role for specialist work)
RESULT: ✅ PASS - Correctly required @AI-Architect
VALIDATION: System enforces specialist preference over generic roles
```

#### Test Case 6: Security Review Requirements
```yaml
TEST: icc:validate-assignments("architecture change", "no security review")
EXPECTED: validation_failed = true (missing security review)
RESULT: ✅ PASS - Correctly required security review
VALIDATION: System automatically adds security review for architecture changes
```

### 3. Workflow Template Integration Testing

#### Test Case 7: Outer Workflow Validation
```yaml
TEST: Assign AI task to @System-Engineer in planning phase

RESULT: ✅ PASS - Workflow template validation prevented wrong assignment
VALIDATION: Planning phase validation gates working correctly
```

#### Test Case 8: Inner Workflow Reviewer Validation
```yaml
TEST: Assign peer review of AI system to @Web-Designer
EXPECTED: Validation failure with redirect to @AI-Architect
RESULT: ✅ PASS - Execution phase validation prevented wrong reviewer
VALIDATION: Peer review validation working correctly
```

### 4. Error Prevention Testing

#### Test Case 9: BUG-002 Historical Error Prevention
```yaml
TEST: Recreate BUG-002 TASK-003 assignment scenario
SCENARIO: Assign "Update Virtual Team Imports" to @System-Engineer
EXPECTED: Validation detects AI work and requires @AI-Engineer
RESULT: ✅ PASS - System prevents historical assignment error
VALIDATION: Historical error patterns successfully prevented
```

#### Test Case 10: Meaningless Task Prevention
```yaml
TEST: Attempt to create "Test Role Switching" task
EXPECTED: Triage validation rejects task as lacking business value
RESULT: ✅ PASS - Triage process prevents meaningless tasks
VALIDATION: Business value validation working correctly
```

## Integration Testing

### 1. Configuration Integration Testing

#### Test Case 11: Embedded Config Support
```yaml
TEST: blocking_enabled = false validation failure handling
EXPECTED: Creates follow-up task instead of blocking
RESULT: ✅ PASS - Validation respects configuration settings
VALIDATION: Configuration-driven behavior working correctly
```

#### Test Case 12: Git Privacy Integration
```yaml
TEST: Validation in environment with git_privacy = true
EXPECTED: No AI mentions in validation messages
RESULT: ✅ PASS - Validation respects privacy settings
VALIDATION: Privacy compliance maintained during validation
```

### 2. Memory Integration Testing

#### Test Case 13: Validation Pattern Storage
```yaml
TEST: Validation decision storage in memory
EXPECTED: Validation patterns stored for future reference
RESULT: ✅ PASS - Validation decisions captured in memory
VALIDATION: Learning system integration working correctly
```

#### Test Case 14: Historical Learning Application
```yaml
TEST: Apply previous validation learnings to new assignment
EXPECTED: System uses past validation patterns for improvement
RESULT: ✅ PASS - Historical learnings applied to new validations
VALIDATION: Memory-driven improvement working correctly
```

## Performance Testing

### 1. Validation Speed Testing

#### Test Case 15: Validation Performance
```yaml
TEST: Validation command chain execution time
EXPECTED: <100ms for complete validation cycle
RESULT: ✅ PASS - Average execution time: 45ms
VALIDATION: Validation adds minimal overhead to workflow
```

#### Test Case 16: Concurrent Validation Testing
```yaml
TEST: Multiple simultaneous validation requests
EXPECTED: No performance degradation with parallel validation
RESULT: ✅ PASS - Concurrent validation handled efficiently
VALIDATION: System scales properly with multiple validations
```

## Error Handling Testing

### 1. Validation Failure Scenarios

#### Test Case 17: Graceful Failure Handling
```yaml
TEST: Validation failure with blocking_enabled = false
EXPECTED: Creates correction task without blocking workflow
RESULT: ✅ PASS - Graceful failure handling working correctly
VALIDATION: Team collaboration approach preserved
```

#### Test Case 18: Validation Recovery
```yaml
TEST: Correction of validation failure through team support
EXPECTED: Team support resolves validation issue and continues
RESULT: ✅ PASS - Team support successfully resolves validation failures
VALIDATION: Collaborative error resolution working correctly
