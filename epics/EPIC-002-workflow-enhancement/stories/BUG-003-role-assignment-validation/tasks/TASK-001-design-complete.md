# TASK-001 Design Complete

**Task:** Design Role Assignment Validation System
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Completed by:** @AI-Architect
**Date:** 2025-01-16

## Design Summary

Created comprehensive role assignment validation system with:

### 1. Core Validation Module
- `src/behaviors/role-assignment-validator.md` - New validation engine
- Pattern-based work type detection (AI, infrastructure, security, database, frontend)
- Capability matching with 70% threshold requirement
- Intelligent role suggestions when validation fails

### 2. Validation Command Chain
```yaml
icc:detect-work-type → icc:require-triage → icc:validate-assignments → icc:require-approval
```

### 3. Work Type Detection Patterns
- **AI/Agentic**: Detects AI, ML, behavioral, automation patterns → Requires @AI-Architect
- **Infrastructure**: Detects deployment, cloud, system patterns → Requires @System-Architect  
- **Security**: Detects auth, encryption, security patterns → Requires @Security-Architect
- **Database**: Detects SQL, schema, migration patterns → Requires @Database-Architect
- **Frontend**: Detects UI, React, component patterns → Requires @Frontend-Architect

### 4. Capability Matching System
- Calculates match percentage between role capabilities and task requirements
- 70% threshold for valid assignments
- Considers exact and related capabilities
- Provides ranked suggestions when match fails

### 5. Architect Approval Workflow
- Mandatory specialist architect review for all detected work types
- PM + Architect joint triage requirement
- Blocking validation until approval received
- Clear approval status tracking

### 6. Integration Points
- Enhanced `lean-workflow-executor.md` with validation imports
- Updated `assign_role` function to use validator
- Added validation chain to story planning workflow
- Maintains lightweight approach

## Validation Rules Implemented

1. **Specialist Preference**: Always prefer specialists over generic roles
2. **Capability Match**: Minimum 70% match required
3. **Blocked Assignments**: Prevent obviously wrong role assignments
4. **Meaningful Work**: Validate task has clear business value
5. **Duplicate Prevention**: No duplicate roles in same task batch

## Next Steps

Ready for TASK-002: Implementation in lean workflow executor
