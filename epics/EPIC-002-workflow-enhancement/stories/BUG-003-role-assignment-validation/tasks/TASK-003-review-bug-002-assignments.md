**Status**: PLANNED  
**Created**: 2025-07-15 12:30:00  
**Updated**: 2025-07-15 12:30:00  
**Owner**: @AI-Architect  
**Priority**: P0 (Critical Path - Unblocks BUG-002)  
**Complexity**: Standard  
**Effort**: Standard  
**Impact**: Critical - Validates BUG-002 can proceed safely  
**Scope**: Specific - BUG-002 role assignment review  

## Requirements Reference

From BUG-003 blocking BUG-002:
- Review and approve all role assignments in BUG-002 tasks
- Validate task assignments for @AI-Engineer vs @AI-Architect appropriateness
