## Capability Assessment

### @AI-Engineer Capabilities for BUG-002
- **Implementation Expertise:** ✅ HIGH
- **Module Understanding:** ✅ SUFFICIENT with oversight
- **Import System Knowledge:** ✅ ADEQUATE
- **Documentation Skills:** ✅ GOOD

### Identified Gaps and Mitigations
1. **Complex Behavioral Removal:** Mitigated by architect checkpoints
2. **Architectural Decisions:** Covered by TASK-001 architect analysis
3. **System Impact Assessment:** Addressed through staged approach

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Tasks
**TASK-002: Remove Old Behavioral Modules**
- **Risks:** Could remove essential functionality
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Architect review of removal plan
  - Staged removal with testing
  - Rollback capability maintained

### Medium-Risk Tasks
**TASK-003: Update Virtual Team Imports**
- **Risks:** Import chain breakage
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test after each import change
  - Validate full system loads

## Execution Requirements

### Oversight Schedule
1. **Before TASK-002 Execution:** @AI-Architect reviews removal plan
2. **During TASK-002:** Staged removal with validation
3. **After TASK-003:** Full system import test
4. **Before TASK-006:** Final architecture validation

### Success Criteria
- No essential functionality removed
- All imports resolve correctly
- System remains functional throughout
- Knowledge properly captured

## FORMAL APPROVAL

**As @AI-Architect, I hereby APPROVE all role assignments in BUG-002 with the following conditions:**

1. @AI-Engineer proceeds with TASK-002 using staged removal approach
2. Architect checkpoint reviews as specified above
3. Full system testing after import changes
4. Rollback plan maintained throughout

**BUG-002 is UNBLOCKED and may proceed with execution.**

## Recommendations

1. **Staged Execution:** Remove behavioral modules in groups, test between
2. **Import Validation:** Use automated import checking after changes
3. **Documentation Focus:** Capture WHY decisions were made
4. **Learning Emphasis:** Document patterns for future similar work
