# TASK-004 Update Workflow Templates with Validation - COMPLETE

**Task:** Update Workflow Templates with Validation  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Engineer  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 12:35:00

## Task Summary

Successfully integrated role assignment validation command chains into both outer and inner workflow templates, ensuring mandatory validation gates are enforced during planning and execution phases.

## Changes Made

### 1. Outer Workflow Template (`outer-workflow-corrected.yaml`)

#### Enhanced Task Assignment Section
```yaml
- id: "assign_specialists"
  action: "Match tasks to specialist roles"
  validation:
    - "Capability match > 70%"
    - "Create specialist if needed"
    - "Load balancing considered"
  validation_commands:
    - "icc:detect-work-type(task_content)"
    - "icc:require-triage(pm_role, specialist_architect)"
    - "icc:validate-assignments(task, proposed_role)"
    - "icc:require-approval(pm_role, specialist_architect)"
```

#### Enhanced Pre-Task Assignment Hook
```yaml
pre_task_assignment:
  description: "Before assigning tasks"
  timing: "before_task_decomposition"
  allows: ["inject", "validate"]
  validation_required:
    - "icc:detect-work-type() for all tasks"
    - "icc:require-triage() for PM + Specialist Architect approval"
    - "icc:validate-assignments() for capability matching"
```

#### Added Role Assignment Validation Rules
```yaml
role_assignment_validation:
  - "AI-agentic work requires @AI-Architect or @AI-Engineer"
  - "Infrastructure work requires @System-Engineer or @DevOps-Engineer"
  - "Peer reviews assigned to domain expert SMEs only"
  - "Capability match >70% required for all assignments"
  - "Security reviews mandatory for architecture changes"
  - "PM + Specialist Architect triage required for all assignments"
```

### 2. Inner Workflow Template (`inner-workflow-corrected.yaml`)

#### Enhanced Reviewer Assignment Section
```yaml
- id: "assign_reviewer"
  action: "Find appropriate reviewer"
  criteria:
    - "Domain expertise"
    - "Not task implementer"
    - "Available capacity"
  validation_commands:
    - "icc:detect-work-type(task_content)"
    - "icc:validate-assignments(review_task, proposed_reviewer)"
```

#### Added Role Assignment Validation Section
```yaml
role_assignment_validation:
  - "Task assigned to appropriate specialist"
  - "Reviewer has domain expertise"
  - "No generic roles for specialist work"
  - "Capability match >70% verified"
  - "Security reviews required for architecture tasks"
```

## Integration Benefits

### 1. Mandatory Validation Gates
- **Planning Phase**: All task assignments must pass validation before story creation
- **Execution Phase**: All reviewer assignments must pass validation before peer review
- **Automatic Detection**: Work type detection automatically identifies required specialist type

### 2. Command Chain Integration
- **icc:detect-work-type()**: Automatically identifies AI-agentic, infrastructure, or domain-specific work
- **icc:require-triage()**: Enforces PM + Specialist Architect collaboration for all assignments
- **icc:validate-assignments()**: Ensures >70% capability match and specialist preference
- **icc:require-approval()**: Blocks assignment creation until joint approval completed

### 3. Prevention of Assignment Errors
- **AI Work Protection**: AI-agentic work automatically requires @AI-Architect or @AI-Engineer
- **Infrastructure Protection**: Infrastructure work requires @System-Engineer or @DevOps-Engineer
- **Peer Review Quality**: Only domain expert SMEs can perform peer reviews
- **Security Requirement**: Architecture changes automatically require security reviews

## Validation Command Flow

### Outer Workflow (Planning Phase)
```
1. Task identified → icc:detect-work-type(task_content)
2. Work type detected → icc:require-triage(pm_role, specialist_architect)
3. Triage complete → icc:validate-assignments(task, proposed_role)
4. Validation passed → icc:require-approval(pm_role, specialist_architect)
5. Approval granted → Assignment created
```

### Inner Workflow (Execution Phase)
```
1. Peer review needed → icc:detect-work-type(task_content)
2. Work type detected → icc:validate-assignments(review_task, proposed_reviewer)
3. Validation passed → Reviewer assigned
4. Review completed → Task validation continues
```

## Error Prevention

### 1. Assignment Validation Errors
- **Generic Architect Used**: System detects AI work and requires @AI-Architect
- **Wrong Specialist**: System detects infrastructure work and requires @System-Engineer
- **Inappropriate Reviewer**: System detects domain mismatch and requires SME

### 2. Planning Phase Errors
- **Missing Triage**: System blocks assignment until PM + Specialist Architect approval
- **Capability Mismatch**: System blocks assignment until >70% capability match
- **Security Gap**: System automatically adds security review for architecture changes

### 3. Execution Phase Errors
- **Wrong Reviewer**: System validates reviewer has domain expertise
- **Generic Assignment**: System prevents generic roles for specialist work
- **Missing Validation**: System ensures all assignments pass validation gates

## Configuration Integration

### Embedded Config Support
Both templates respect embedded configuration settings:
- **git_privacy**: Sanitizes AI mentions in commit messages
- **blocking_enabled**: Determines whether validation failures block or create follow-up tasks
- **memory_integration**: Ensures knowledge capture and retrieval

### Validation Flexibility
- **L3 Autonomy**: Validation runs automatically without user intervention
- **Team Collaboration**: Validation errors trigger team support rather than hard blocks
- **Continuous Learning**: Validation patterns stored for future improvement

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Validation Integration
- ✅ **Command Chain References**: All validation commands reference existing lean-workflow-executor implementations
- ✅ **Configuration Compatibility**: Templates respect embedded configuration settings
- ✅ **Hook Integration**: Validation hooks properly integrated into workflow phases
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Validation failures handled according to blocking_enabled setting

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ **Existing Workflows**: All existing workflow functionality preserved
- ✅ **Configuration Support**: All configuration options continue to work
- ✅ **Extension Points**: Hooks and validation points maintain extensibility

## Implementation Impact

### 1. Immediate Benefits
- **Assignment Quality**: All future assignments will pass validation gates
- **Error Prevention**: Systematic prevention of wrong specialist assignments
- **Process Consistency**: Consistent validation across planning and execution phases

### 2. Long-term Impact
- **Quality Improvement**: Continuous improvement through validation pattern learning
- **Team Efficiency**: Reduced rework from wrong assignments
- **System Reliability**: Consistent governance without complex enforcement

### 3. User Experience
- **Transparent Validation**: Validation happens automatically without user disruption
- **Clear Feedback**: Validation failures provide clear guidance for correction
- **Collaborative Support**: Team support for validation issues rather than hard blocks

## Next Steps

### Integration with BUG-003
This task completion enables:
- **TASK-005**: Testing validation system with updated workflow templates
- **TASK-006**: Documentation updates to reflect validation integration
- **TASK-007**: Deployment of complete validation system

### Continuous Improvement
- **Validation Effectiveness**: Monitor prevention of assignment errors
- **Process Refinement**: Collect feedback on validation experience
- **System Enhancement**: Iterate on validation patterns based on usage
