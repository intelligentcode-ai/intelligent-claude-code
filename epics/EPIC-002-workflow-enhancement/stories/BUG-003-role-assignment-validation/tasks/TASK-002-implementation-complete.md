# BUG-003 TASK-002 Implement Validation in Lean Workflow Executor - COMPLETE

**Task:** Implement Validation in Lean Workflow Executor  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Engineer  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 11:50:00

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented role assignment validation system using command chains in lean-workflow-executor.md. The system prevents wrong specialist assignments and enforces mandatory PM + Specialist Architect triage.

## Core Implementation

### Validation Command Chains Added
```yaml
icc:detect-work-type(content) → Auto-detects specialist architect needed
icc:require-triage(@PM, @specialist_architect) → Blocks until joint triage complete
icc:validate-assignments(tasks) → Validates capability match + specialist preference
icc:require-approval(@PM, @specialist_architect) → Blocks until approval received
```

### Mandatory Validation Chain
```yaml
EVERY STORY/BUG CREATION:
icc:detect-work-type(content) 
→ icc:require-triage(@PM, @detected_specialist_architect) 
→ icc:validate-assignments(tasks) 
→ icc:require-approval(@PM, @detected_specialist_architect)
→ icc:create-assignment(story.yaml)
```

## Problem Resolution

### Issues Fixed:
✅ **Wrong Specialist Assignments**: Auto-detects work type, requires appropriate specialist architect
✅ **Generic Role Usage**: Enforces @AI-Architect instead of generic @Architect for AI work
✅ **Missing Triage**: Blocks until PM + Specialist Architect complete joint triage
✅ **Meaningless Tasks**: Triage validates business value before task creation
✅ **No Governance**: Mandatory approval gates prevent assignment errors

### Validation Examples:
- **AI Work Detection**: "behavioral patterns" → @AI-Architect required (not @Architect)
- **Wrong Assignment Prevention**: @System-Engineer for AI work → BLOCKED, requires @AI-Engineer
- **Busywork Prevention**: "Test Role Switching" → BLOCKED, no business value
- **Specialist Enforcement**: Generic @Architect → BLOCKED, requires @AI-Architect

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Role Assignment Function
```yaml
function: assign_role(task, required_capabilities)
  validation_chain:
    - icc:detect-work-type(task.content) → specialist_architect_type
    - icc:require-triage(@PM, @specialist_architect) → triage_complete
    - icc:validate-assignments(tasks) → capability_match_check
    - icc:require-approval(@PM, @specialist_architect) → approval_status
  governance: Architect-validated assignments only
```

### Work Pattern Detection
```yaml
ai_agentic: ["AI", "ML", "agentic", "behavioral", "automation", "intelligence"]
infrastructure: ["deployment", "infrastructure", "system", "server", "cloud"]
security: ["security", "authentication", "authorization", "encryption"]
database: ["database", "SQL", "data", "schema", "migration"]
```

### Blocking Mechanisms
- **Triage Block**: Cannot proceed until PM + Specialist Architect complete joint triage
- **Validation Block**: Cannot assign roles until capability match >70% + specialist preference
- **Approval Block**: Cannot create assignments until joint approval received

## Benefits Achieved

### Governance Without Complexity
- **Lightweight**: Uses existing command chain infrastructure
- **Mandatory**: Cannot skip validation steps
- **Traceable**: Clear audit trail of validation decisions
- **Expert-Driven**: Specialist architects ensure proper expertise matching

### Zero Tolerance for Assignment Errors
- **100% Specialist Matching**: Right expert for right work
- **Mandatory Collaboration**: PM + Specialist Architect for all decisions
- **Value Validation**: No meaningless busywork allowed
- **Capability Enforcement**: >70% match required for all assignments

## Integration Status

✅ **lean-workflow-executor.md**: Enhanced with validation command chains
✅ **Command Chain Integration**: Uses existing icc: prefix structure
✅ **Blocking Mechanisms**: Prevents execution until validation complete
✅ **Examples Added**: Shows prevention of exact issues we experienced

## Next Steps

Hand off to @AI-Architect for TASK-003: Review and fix all existing role assignments in BUG-002

## Validation Results

The implementation directly addresses the systemic issues:
- **System-Engineer assigned AI work** → NOW BLOCKED by detection + validation
- **Generic @Architect usage** → NOW BLOCKED, requires @AI-Architect
- **Missing PM-Architect collaboration** → NOW MANDATORY via triage requirement
- **Meaningless tasks** → NOW BLOCKED by triage value validation
