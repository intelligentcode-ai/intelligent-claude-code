# TASK-001: Design Role Assignment Validation System

**Status**: PLANNED  
**Created**: 2025-07-15 12:30:00  
**Updated**: 2025-07-15 12:30:00  
**Owner**: @AI-Architect  
**Priority**: P0 (Blocking - Critical Governance Gap)  
**Complexity**: High  
**Effort**: Standard  
**Impact**: Critical - Prevents wrong role assignments system-wide  
**Scope**: Extensive - Role governance framework  

## Requirements Reference

From BUG-003 (Missing Role Assignment Validation):
- Design comprehensive role assignment validation system
- Define validation criteria and triggers for architect approval
- Establish architect approval workflow integration
- Create AI-agentic work detection patterns
- Design validation integration points with lean workflow

## Problem Context

**CRITICAL GOVERNANCE GAP**: The lean workflow executor has NO mandatory role assignment validation by specialist architect. This allows:
- Wrong specialists assigned to AI/ML work
- Complex technical decisions without architectural oversight  
- Specialist creation without validation
- System-wide role assignment quality issues

## Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Validation Criteria Definition**
- [ ] Define triggers requiring architect approval (AI/ML, complex technical, specialist creation)
- [ ] Establish capability matching thresholds for validation
- [ ] Create validation decision matrix
- [ ] Document validation requirements clearly

✅ **AI-Agentic Work Detection**
- [ ] Design patterns to detect AI/ML/agentic work
- [ ] Create keyword and context detection rules
- [ ] Define mandatory @AI-Architect + @AI-Engineer pairing
- [ ] Establish validation criteria for AI system work

✅ **Architect Approval Workflow**
- [ ] Design approval process integration with lean workflow
- [ ] Create notification and review mechanisms
- [ ] Define approval documentation requirements
- [ ] Establish escalation paths for disagreements

✅ **Integration Points**
- [ ] Map integration with lean-workflow-executor.md assign_role function
- [ ] Design workflow template integration
- [ ] Plan assignment template updates
- [ ] Create validation checkpoints in execution flow

✅ **Quality Assurance Framework**
- [ ] Design role assignment quality metrics
- [ ] Create validation effectiveness measures
- [ ] Establish continuous improvement mechanisms
- [ ] Plan validation audit trails

## Design Requirements

### Validation Triggers
```yaml
validation_required_for:
  ai_agentic_work:
    - Keywords: "AI", "ML", "agentic", "behavioral", "autonomous"
    - File patterns: "behaviors/", "modes/", AI-related directories
    - Complex algorithms and decision systems
    - Mandatory: @AI-Architect + specialist approval
    
  complex_technical:
    - System architecture changes
    - Cross-domain technical work
    - Security-critical implementations
    - Performance-critical systems
    - Mandatory: @AI-Architect review
    
  specialist_creation:
    - Capability match <70%
    - New domain expertise required
    - Custom role definitions needed
    - Mandatory: @AI-Architect validation of need and definition
```

### Approval Workflow
```yaml
validation_workflow:
  detection:
    - Automatic trigger identification
    - Context analysis for validation requirements
    - Priority and urgency assessment
    
  notification:
    - @AI-Architect automatic notification
    - Provide full context and requirements
    - Include capability gap analysis
    - Set approval timeline expectations
    
  review:
    - Architect expertise assessment
    - Alternative options evaluation
    - Risk and quality analysis
    - Explicit approval or modification
    
  documentation:
    - Capture approval rationale
    - Document alternative considerations
    - Record validation decision
    - Enable audit trail maintenance
```

### Integration Design
```yaml
lean_workflow_integration:
  assign_role_function:
    - Add validation step before assignment
    - Integrate architect approval requirement
    - Handle approval workflow seamlessly
    - Maintain execution flow efficiency
    
  workflow_templates:
    - Add validation checkpoints
    - Include architect approval steps
    - Update assignment patterns
    - Maintain lean execution model
    
  assignment_templates:
    - Include validation requirements
    - Add architect approval tracking
    - Update role assignment patterns
    - Maintain template simplicity
```

## Architecture Decisions Required

### Decision 1: Validation Integration Approach
**Options:**
- A) Inline validation within assign_role function
- B) Separate validation service with async approval
- C) Hybrid approach with sync validation + async complex approval

**Recommendation Needed**: Choose optimal approach for lean workflow

### Decision 2: AI-Agentic Work Detection
**Options:**
- A) Keyword-based detection with pattern matching
- B) Content analysis with context understanding
- C) Explicit tagging in assignment files

**Recommendation Needed**: Choose detection method for accuracy and efficiency

### Decision 3: Approval Workflow Integration
**Options:**
- A) Blocking approval (halt execution until approved)
- B) Non-blocking with follow-up validation
- C) Conditional blocking based on risk level

**Recommendation Needed**: Choose approach that maintains lean execution while ensuring quality
