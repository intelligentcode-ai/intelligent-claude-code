# TASK-002: Implement Validation in Lean Workflow Executor

**Status**: PLANNED  
**Created**: 2025-07-15 12:30:00  
**Updated**: 2025-07-15 12:30:00  
**Owner**: @AI-Engineer  
**Priority**: P0 (Critical Path - Blocking BUG-002)  
**Complexity**: High  
**Effort**: Extended  
**Impact**: Critical - Implements role assignment governance  
**Scope**: Core - Lean workflow executor modification  

## Requirements Reference

From BUG-003 and TASK-001 design:
- Implement role assignment validation system in lean-workflow-executor.md
- Update assign_role function with mandatory architect validation
- Add AI-agentic work detection and approval workflow
- Integrate validation with workflow execution seamlessly
- Ensure no bypass capability for critical role assignments

## Problem Context

**IMPLEMENTATION GAP**: Current assign_role function (lines 27-34) has no validation:
```yaml
function: assign_role(task, required_capabilities)
  logic:
    - Calculate capability match
    - If <70%: Create specialist
    - Return assigned role
  no_validation: Missing architect approval  # ← CRITICAL GAP
```

Must be enhanced to:
```yaml
function: assign_role(task, required_capabilities)
  logic:
    - Calculate capability match
    - If AI/ML work: Require @AI-Architect validation
    - If complex technical: Require @AI-Architect review
    - If <70%: Create specialist with architect approval
    - Return validated role assignment
  mandatory_validation: Architect approval enforced  # ← REQUIRED
```

## Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Enhanced assign_role Function**
- [ ] Implement validation triggers detection (AI/ML, complex technical, specialist creation)
- [ ] Add mandatory @AI-Architect approval step for triggered cases
- [ ] Integrate validation workflow seamlessly with lean execution
- [ ] Ensure no bypass capability for validation requirements

✅ **AI-Agentic Work Detection**

- [ ] Enforce mandatory @AI-Architect + specialist pairing for AI work

✅ **Architect Approval Workflow**
- [ ] Implement automatic @AI-Architect notification system
- [ ] Create approval request with full context and requirements
- [ ] Add approval tracking and documentation
- [ ] Integrate approval response into assignment flow

✅ **Validation Integration**
- [ ] Update workflow execution to use enhanced assign_role
- [ ] Modify task assignment patterns to include validation
- [ ] Ensure validation doesn't disrupt lean execution flow
- [ ] Add validation audit trail to assignment records

✅ **Error Handling and Quality**
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for validation failures
- [ ] Add validation bypass prevention mechanisms  
- [ ] Create clear error messages for validation requirements
- [ ] Ensure graceful handling of approval delays

    assignment_templates:
      - add validation requirements fields
      - include architect approval tracking
      - update role assignment documentation

  triggers:
    ai_agentic_work: Keywords, file patterns, behavioral modifications
    complex_technical: System architecture, cross-domain, security-critical
    specialist_creation: Capability gap >70%, new domain expertise
