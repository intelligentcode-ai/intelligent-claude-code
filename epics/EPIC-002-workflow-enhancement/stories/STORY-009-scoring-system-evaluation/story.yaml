problem_description: |
  The current system has a complex scoring system (P/Q scores, penalties, bonuses).
  We need to evaluate whether this adds value in the lean system or if it's
  just more complexity that should be removed. The team should decide what
  value it provides and whether to keep, simplify, or remove it.
  
key_questions:
  - Does scoring motivate better work quality?
  - Does it help identify performance issues?
  - Is it used for learning and improvement?
  - Does it add unnecessary complexity?
  - Would the system work better without it?
  - What are the benefits vs overhead?
  
acceptance_criteria:
  - Team evaluates current scoring system value
  - Analysis of complexity vs benefit
  - Decision on keep/modify/remove
  - If keeping: simplified implementation
  - If removing: clean removal plan
  - Documentation of decision rationale

evaluation_criteria:
  value_assessment:
    - "Does it improve work quality?"
    - "Does it facilitate learning?"
    - "Does it identify issues early?"
    - "Is it actually used for decisions?"
  
  complexity_assessment:
    - "How much overhead does it add?"
    - "How often do penalties/bonuses matter?"
    - "Is the calculation effort worth it?"
    - "Does it distract from actual work?"
  
  alternatives:
    - "Simple completion tracking only"
    - "Qualitative feedback instead"
    - "Learning capture without scores"
    - "No scoring at all"
