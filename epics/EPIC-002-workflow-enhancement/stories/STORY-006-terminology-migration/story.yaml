problem_description: |
  The system currently uses inconsistent terminology throughout the codebase.
  Need to fix epic→story→task→subtask hierarchy to ensure consistency across
  all documentation, templates, and behavioral modules.
  
acceptance_criteria:
  - All files use consistent epic→story→task→subtask terminology
  - Assignment templates updated with correct hierarchy
  - Workflow templates reference correct terminology
  - Documentation updated throughout system
  - No mixed terminology remains
  
embedded_config:
  autonomy_level: "L3"
  pm_always_active: true
  memory_integration: true
  blocking_enabled: false
  git_privacy: true
  
current_terminology_issues:
  inconsistent_usage:
    - Some files use "task" to mean "story"
    - Some files use "subtask" to mean "task"
    - Assignment templates mix terminology
    - Workflow templates inconsistent
    - Documentation uses multiple conventions
    
  correct_hierarchy:
    - Epic: Large initiative (months of work)
    - Story: Feature implementation (weeks of work)
    - Task: Specific work item (days of work)
    - Subtask: Granular step (hours of work)
    
workflow_references:
  outer_workflow: "workflow-templates/outer-workflow.yaml"
  inner_workflow: "workflow-templates/inner-workflow.yaml"
  assignment_templates: "templates/"
  
integration_requirements:
  - Update all assignment templates
  - Fix workflow template references
  - Update behavioral module documentation
  - Fix role assignment patterns
  - Update scoring system references
  
technical_details:
  affected_files:
    - "templates/*.yaml" (assignment templates)
    - "workflow-templates/*.yaml" (workflow definitions)
    - "src/behaviors/*.md" (behavioral modules)
    - "src/roles/*.md" (role definitions)
    - "docs/*.md" (documentation)
    - "epics/**/*.yaml" (existing assignments)
    
  migration_pattern:
    - Audit current terminology usage
    - Define correct hierarchy mapping
    - Update templates and workflows
    - Update existing assignment files
    - Update documentation

notes:
  - P0 Critical - foundation for all other work
  - Affects all assignment templates and workflows
  - Must be completed before other stories can be properly implemented
  - Ensures consistency across entire system
