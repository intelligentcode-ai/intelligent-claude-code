problem_description: |
  System uses incorrect terminology throughout:
  - Current "tasks" are actually stories
  - Current "subtasks" are actually tasks
  - Missing proper epic structure
  - File organization doesn't match hierarchy
  
acceptance_criteria:
  - All templates use correct terminology
  - File structure matches epic→story→task hierarchy
  - Commands work with proper terms
  - Examples demonstrate correct usage
  - Migration script for existing work

affected_components:
  templates:
    - "templates/assignment-template.yaml" → "templates/story-assignment-template.yaml"
    - Need: "templates/task-assignment-template.yaml"
    - Need: "templates/bug-assignment-template.yaml"
    - Need: "templates/epic-template.yaml"
    
  workflows:
    - "workflow-templates/outer-workflow.yaml" → Must create stories, not tasks
    - "workflow-templates/inner-workflow.yaml" → Must execute tasks, not subtasks
    
  commands:
    - All commands must use correct terminology
    - "icc:plan-task" → "icc:plan-story"
    - "icc:execute-task" → Remains (correct)
    - Need: "icc:create-story", "icc:create-bug"
    
  documentation:
    - All examples must show correct hierarchy
    - README files need updates
    - Command help text corrections
    
migration_script_requirements:
  - Move /tasks/* → /epics/EPIC-002/stories/*/
  - Rename "subtasks" → "tasks" in story files
  - Create proper epic structure
  - Update all references
  - Preserve git history
