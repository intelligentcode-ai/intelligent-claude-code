# TASK-008: Update Documentation

**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Engineer  
**Story:** STORY-006 Terminology Migration  
**Priority:** P0 CRITICAL

## Memory Consultation Results

Based on TASK-007 comprehensive testing results, the documentation was found to be 100% consistent with proper terminology. However, let me verify and document any final updates needed.

**Previous Results:**
- TASK-007: Documentation testing 100% passed
- CLAUDE.md already uses correct terminology
- Template documentation already correct
- Workflow documentation already correct

## Documentation Review Results

### Primary Documentation Files

#### CLAUDE.md (Main Documentation)
**Status:** ✅ ALREADY CORRECT
- **System overview** uses correct Epic→Story/Bug→Task→Subtask hierarchy
- **Architecture description** maintains consistent terminology
- **Component references** use proper terms throughout
- **Integration examples** show correct usage patterns

#### Template Documentation
**Status:** ✅ ALREADY CORRECT
- **Epic template** comments use correct terminology
- **Story template** comments use correct terminology  
- **Bug template** comments use correct terminology
- **Task template** comments use correct terminology

#### Workflow Documentation
**Status:** ✅ ALREADY CORRECT
- **Outer workflow** comments use correct terminology
- **Inner workflow** comments use correct terminology
- **Phase descriptions** maintain consistency
- **Integration points** use proper terms

#### Behavioral Module Documentation
**Status:** ✅ ALREADY CORRECT
- **lean-workflow-executor.md** uses correct terminology
- **Role activation** uses correct terminology
- **All behavioral modules** maintain consistency

### Minor Documentation Enhancements

Based on the comprehensive testing, the documentation is already 100% correct. However, I can add a terminology reference section to help future developers maintain consistency.

## Documentation Enhancement

### Adding Terminology Reference Section

Since the system is already perfectly consistent, I'll add a quick reference section to help maintain this consistency in the future:

**Enhancement:** Add terminology reference to CLAUDE.md

## Documentation Enhancement Complete

### Added Terminology Reference Section

**Location:** `/Users/ksamaschke/Work/Engineering/intelligent-claude-code/CLAUDE.md`

**Added Section:** "## Terminology Reference"

### Contents of New Section:

#### 1. Work Item Hierarchy
Complete definition of Epic→Story/Bug→Task→Subtask hierarchy with:
- Clear definitions for each level
- Examples for each work item type
- File naming conventions
- Time spans for each level

#### 2. Terminology Standards
Explicit standards for consistent usage:
- **Epic**: Always refers to the largest work container
- **Story**: Always refers to feature implementation work
- **Bug**: Always refers to issue resolution work
- **Task**: Always refers to specific work items within stories/bugs
- **Subtask**: Always refers to granular steps within tasks

#### 3. Cross-References
Standard phrases for referencing relationships:
- **Epic → Stories/Bugs**: "This epic contains stories and bugs"
- **Story → Tasks**: "This story contains tasks"
- **Bug → Tasks**: "This bug contains tasks"
- **Task → Subtasks**: "This task contains subtasks" (optional)

#### 4. Git Integration
Terminology alignment with Git operations:
- **Epic Level**: Repository and major branch management
- **Story/Bug Level**: Feature branch creation and management
- **Task Level**: Commits and pushes within feature branches
- **Subtask Level**: Individual commits within task scope

#### 5. Workflow Alignment
Terminology integration with workflow system:
- **Outer Workflow**: Handles Epic/Story/Bug level coordination
- **Inner Workflow**: Handles Task level execution
- **Role Assignment**: Specialists assigned to tasks, not stories/bugs
- **Progress Tracking**: Hierarchical progress from task → story/bug → epic

## Documentation Quality Assessment

### ✅ **ENHANCEMENT COMPLETE**
The documentation has been enhanced with:
- **Comprehensive terminology reference** for future developers
