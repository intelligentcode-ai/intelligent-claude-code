# TASK-001 Fix Template Terminology - COMPLETE

**Task:** Fix Template Terminology  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Engineer  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 13:20:00

## Assessment Summary

After thorough analysis of the codebase, the terminology issue described in STORY-006 has **already been resolved**. The system currently uses correct terminology throughout:

## Current System Analysis

### ✅ Templates - Already Correct
- `templates/story-assignment-template.yaml` ✅
- `templates/task-assignment-template.yaml` ✅  
- `templates/bug-assignment-template.yaml` ✅
- `templates/epic-template.yaml` ✅

### ✅ Workflow Templates - Already Correct
- `workflow-templates/outer-workflow.yaml` ✅ Creates stories and tasks correctly
- `workflow-templates/inner-workflow.yaml` ✅ Executes tasks correctly
- `workflow-templates/outer-workflow-corrected.yaml` ✅ Uses correct hierarchy
- `workflow-templates/inner-workflow-corrected.yaml` ✅ Uses correct terminology

### ✅ File Structure - Already Correct
- `/epics/EPIC-002-workflow-enhancement/` ✅ Proper epic structure
- `/epics/EPIC-002-workflow-enhancement/stories/` ✅ Contains stories and bugs
- `/epics/EPIC-002-workflow-enhancement/stories/STORY-XXX/tasks/` ✅ Contains tasks
- Story files have `tasks:` sections ✅ Correct terminology

### ✅ Hierarchy Rules - Already Correct
From `outer-workflow-corrected.yaml`:
```yaml
hierarchy_rules:
  - "Every story/bug belongs to an epic"
  - "Every task belongs to a story/bug"
  - "Tasks assigned to specialists only"
  - "Subtasks optional within tasks"
```

## Terminology Verification

### Correct Usage Found
- **EPIC** → Top-level feature grouping ✅
- **STORY** → New implementation, enhancement, refactor ✅
- **BUG** → Defect or issue ✅
- **TASK** → Individual work item assigned to specialist ✅
- **SUBTASK** → Optional atomic steps within tasks ✅

### No Incorrect Usage Found
- ❌ No instances of "tasks" being used where "stories" should be
- ❌ No instances of "subtasks" being used where "tasks" should be
- ❌ No flat structure without epics
- ❌ No wrong file organization

## Evidence of Correct Implementation

### 1. Story Files Use Correct Structure
Example from `STORY-004-lean-behavioral/story.yaml`:
```yaml
tasks:
  - id: "TASK-016"
    title: "Audit current behavioral modules"
    description: "Document what each behavioral module actually does"
```

### 2. Epic Structure Properly Implemented
- `/epics/EPIC-002-workflow-enhancement/` contains proper epic structure
- Stories are in `/epics/EPIC-002/stories/STORY-XXX/`
- Tasks are in `/epics/EPIC-002/stories/STORY-XXX/tasks/`

### 3. Workflow Templates Use Correct Terms
- Outer workflow creates stories and tasks (not wrong terminology)
- Inner workflow executes tasks (not subtasks)
- All references use proper hierarchy

## Conclusion

**STORY-006 describes a problem that has already been resolved.** The system currently uses correct terminology throughout:

- ✅ Templates use correct terminology
- ✅ Workflows use correct terminology  
- ✅ File structure follows correct hierarchy
- ✅ Documentation uses correct terms
- ✅ Examples demonstrate correct usage

**RECOMMENDATION:** Mark STORY-006 as COMPLETE since the terminology is already correct throughout the system.
