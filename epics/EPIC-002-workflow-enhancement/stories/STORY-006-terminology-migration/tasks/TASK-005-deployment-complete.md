**Assigned to:** @AI-Engineer  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 13:24:00

## Deployment Summary

After comprehensive analysis, no deployment is needed because the terminology issue described in STORY-006 does not exist in the current system.

## Evidence Review

### All Previous Tasks Confirmed
- **TASK-001:** Templates already use correct terminology ✅
- **TASK-002:** Workflows already use correct terminology ✅
- **TASK-003:** Documentation already uses correct terminology ✅
- **TASK-004:** Testing confirms system already correct ✅

### System Already Implements Correct Hierarchy
- **EPIC** → `/epics/EPIC-XXX/` ✅
- **STORY/BUG** → `/epics/EPIC-XXX/stories/STORY-XXX/` ✅
- **TASK** → `/epics/EPIC-XXX/stories/STORY-XXX/tasks/` ✅
- **SUBTASK** → Optional within tasks ✅

## Deployment Result

**NO CHANGES DEPLOYED** - System already correct.

## Next Steps

STORY-006 should be marked as COMPLETE with status "ALREADY_RESOLVED" since the terminology migration it describes has already been implemented in the system.
