# TASK-030 Implementation Summary

## Task: Implement /icc-add-task command
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Assigned to:** @AI-Engineer
**Date:** 2025-01-18

## What Was Implemented

Created `/icc-add-task` command for Stage 4 (EXECUTING) workflow phase with the following features:

### Core Functionality
1. **Specialist Access**: Any specialist role can add tasks (not PM-only)
2. **Phase Validation**: Only works when story/bug is in EXECUTING phase
3. **Dynamic Number Allocation**: Finds next available number in appropriate range
4. **Automatic Review Generation**: Creates review tasks for implementation/creation tasks
5. **Task File Creation**: Generates task files with embedded config and project scope

### Task Numbering Integration
- Process tasks: 001-009 (knowledge, settings retrieval)
- Core tasks: 010-994 (implementation, design, testing)
- Wrap-up tasks: 995-999 (docs, deploy, test, git, knowledge)
- Automatic gap detection in used numbers
- Review tasks get +1 numbering after main task

### Key Features
- **Role-based Review Assignment**: Maps implementer to appropriate architect
- **Dependency Support**: Tasks can specify dependencies on existing tasks
- **Project Scope Inheritance**: All tasks inherit parent's project_scope
- **Model Selection**: Sets "sonnet" for non-PM tasks
- **Validation**: Prevents duplicate work and ensures phase requirements

### Usage Example
```bash
icc-add-task STORY-023 "Implement error handling for API calls" --type implementation --assigned-to @Developer --dependencies TASK-020
```

This creates:
- TASK-052: Implementation task for @Developer
- TASK-053: Review task for @System-Architect (auto-generated)

## Success Criteria Met
✅ Any specialist can add tasks (not PM-only)
✅ Uses standardized numbering system with gap detection
✅ Review tasks auto-generated with +1 numbering
✅ Task files created with proper structure
✅ Only works on EXECUTING phase items
✅ Integrates with existing TaskNumberAllocator pattern

## File Created
