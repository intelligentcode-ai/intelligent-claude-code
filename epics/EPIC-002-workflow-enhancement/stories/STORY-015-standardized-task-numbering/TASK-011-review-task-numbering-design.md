- [X] Reviewer assignment logic comprehensive
- [X] Exceptions properly identified
- [X] Domain-specific review mapping complete

### Configuration Structure
- [X] Configuration schema well-structured

## Review Criteria

### Technical Soundness
- Does the design handle edge cases?
- Is the numbering allocation algorithm efficient?
- Are there potential conflicts or race conditions?
- Is the migration strategy safe?

### Alignment with Requirements
- Process tasks use 01-09 ✓
- Core tasks use 10-994 ✓
- Wrap-up tasks use 995-999 ✓
- Every creation/update has review ✓
- Project scope always present ✓

### Implementation Clarity
- Are the pseudocode examples clear?
- Is the integration approach well-defined?
- Are the validation rules comprehensive?
- Is the configuration structure intuitive?

## Embedded Config
```yaml
execution_mode: review
blocking_enabled: true

review_type: design_review
project_scope: "intelligent-claude-code task standardization"
```

## Review Findings

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive Design**: The design covers all aspects of task numbering with clear structure and semantic ranges
- **Automatic Review Generation**: Excellent implementation of the NNN → NNN+1 pattern with smart domain-specific reviewer assignment
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintains TASK-XXX pattern ensuring smooth migration
- **Clear Number Allocation**: TaskNumberAllocator provides conflict-free number assignment with efficient algorithm
- **Project Scope Enforcement**: Mandatory project scope with inheritance from parent items
- **Well-Defined Integration**: Clear hooks into lean-workflow-executor and planning commands
- **Phased Migration**: Smart two-phase approach minimizes disruption
- **Edge Case Handling**: Proper exception lists for review generation (knowledge tasks, git ops, etc.)

### Areas for Improvement
- **Review Task Overflow**: When a task at position 994 needs a review, it would create TASK-995 which collides with the wrap-up range. Need a strategy for this edge case
- **Concurrent Allocation**: The TaskNumberAllocator might face race conditions if multiple tasks are created simultaneously. Consider adding locking mechanism
- **Range Exhaustion**: No clear strategy when a range is exhausted (e.g., more than 90 architecture tasks)
- **Review Chain Depth**: No limit on review chains (review of review of review...)

### Recommendations
1. **Add Overflow Handling**: 
   - Reserve 990-994 as review overflow buffer
   - Or allow reviews to spill into next available range
   
2. **Add Concurrent Safety**:
   ```pseudocode
   FUNCTION allocateNumber(taskType):
       LOCK allocation_mutex:
           // existing allocation logic
       UNLOCK
   ```

3. **Add Range Monitoring**:
   - Warning when range 80% full
   - Automatic range expansion or reallocation strategy

4. **Limit Review Depth**:
   - Maximum 2 levels of review (original → review → final review)
   - Prevent infinite review chains

5. **Add Validation for Special Cases**:
   - Tasks near range boundaries
   - Cross-range dependencies
   - Migration rollback scenarios

## Success Criteria
- Design is technically sound and implementable ✓
- All requirements are addressed ✓
- Integration approach is clear ✓
- Migration strategy is safe ✓
- No major risks identified ✓ (minor risks identified with mitigations suggested)

## Review Decision

**Status**: [X] Approved | [ ] Approved with minor changes | [ ] Needs revision

**Comments**: This is an excellent, well-thought-out design that successfully addresses all requirements. The semantic number ranges, automatic review generation, and phased migration approach are particularly strong. The minor edge cases identified (review overflow, concurrent allocation) can be addressed during implementation without changing the core design. The design provides a solid foundation for standardizing task management across the intelligent-claude-code system.

## Execution Context
This review task validates the task numbering system design before implementation begins. The review ensures the design is complete, technically sound, and ready for implementation across the intelligent-claude-code system.
