# TASK-017: Create Lean Workflow Executor - COMPLETE

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Assigned to:** @AI-Engineer
**Story:** STORY-004 Lean Behavioral System

## Deliverables

### 1. Created lean-workflow-executor-v2.md
- Location: src/behaviors/lean-workflow-executor-v2.md
- Imports: Only 5 essential modules (vs 13+ in original)
- Functions: 4 core functions only
- Token count: ~2,000 tokens (vs ~20,000 in original)

### 2. Key Improvements

#### Before (lean-workflow-executor.md)
- 13+ complex imports
- Complex initialization with 8 subsystems
- L3 continuous engine with loops
- Task queue management
- Auto-continue triggers
- Progress monitoring
- Work discovery engine
- ~20,000 tokens

#### After (lean-workflow-executor-v2.md)
- 5 essential imports only
- Simple function-based execution
- Direct L3 flag check
- No queues or loops
- Simple status updates
- Basic progress tracking
- Manual work discovery
- ~2,000 tokens

### 3. Functionality Preserved
✅ Assignment file reading
✅ Role assignment with validation
✅ Workflow phase execution
✅ Progress updates
✅ Git privacy enforcement
✅ L3 autonomous mode
✅ Configuration management
✅ Memory storage (simplified)

### 4. Complexity Removed
❌ Autonomy controller (replaced with flag check)
❌ PM command system (moves to virtual-team.md)
❌ Complex learning automation
❌ Continuous execution loops
❌ Task queue management
❌ Auto-continue triggers
❌ Progress monitors
❌ Work discovery automation

## Validation

The new lean executor:
1. Reduces tokens by 90% (better than 80% target)
2. Maintains all essential functionality
3. Simplifies maintenance and debugging
4. Improves system clarity

**TASK COMPLETE:** Lean workflow executor v2 created and ready for integration.
