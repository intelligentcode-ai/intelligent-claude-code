# TASK-007: Document ID Conventions

**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Assigned to:** @Requirements-Engineer  
**Type:** documentation  
**Priority:** parallel  
**Created:** 2025-01-18  
**Completed:** 2025-01-18  

## Task Description

Create comprehensive documentation that explains the ID formatting conventions for the intelligent-claude-code behavioral system, ensuring users and AI roles understand how to properly format and assign IDs.

## Objectives

1. ✅ Explain ID formatting conventions for the behavioral system
2. ✅ Document how AI roles should manually assign IDs  
3. ✅ Provide examples for each work item type (EPIC, STORY, BUG, TASK)
4. ✅ Clarify this is behavioral guidance, not software automation
5. ✅ Integrate with existing intelligent-claude-code documentation

## Completion Summary

### Documentation Created

**File:** `/docs/ID-CONVENTIONS.md`

### Key Sections Documented

1. **Overview**
   - Clear statement that this is behavioral documentation
   - Emphasis on manual ID assignment
   - No software automation involved

2. **ID Format Structure**
   - TYPE-NUMBER pattern (EPIC-001, STORY-015, BUG-068)
   - Uppercase types, hyphen separator, 3-digit padding
   - Examples of correct and incorrect formats

3. **Work Item Types**
   - EPICs: Large initiatives (EPIC-XXX)
   - STORIEs: Feature implementations (STORY-XXX)
   - BUGs: Issue resolutions (BUG-XXX)
   - TASKs: Specific work items (TASK-XXX)

4. **ID Assignment Process**
   - Step-by-step manual assignment instructions
   - Practical bash examples for checking existing IDs
   - Directory creation patterns
   - YAML file usage

5. **Best Practices**
   - Sequential numbering guidelines
   - Conflict avoidance strategies
   - Consistency rules
   - Reference tracking

6. **AI Role Guidelines**
   - Role-specific patterns for each specialist
   - Integration with slash commands
   - Validation requirements

7. **Integration Points**
   - How commands import the ID formatting guide
   - Behavioral documentation patterns
   - Emphasis on no automation

8. **Quick Reference**
   - Cheat sheet for ID formats
   - Assignment checklist
   - Troubleshooting common issues

### Documentation Quality

- ✅ **Comprehensive**: Covers all aspects of ID formatting
- ✅ **Clear Examples**: Multiple practical examples for each scenario
- ✅ **Behavioral Focus**: Explicitly states this is NOT software automation
- ✅ **User-Friendly**: Includes checklists and quick references
- ✅ **AI-Aware**: Specific guidance for AI roles in the virtual team

### Integration with Existing Documentation

The new `ID-CONVENTIONS.md` file:
- Complements the existing `id-formatting-guide.md` behavioral module
- Provides user-facing documentation while the guide provides implementation patterns
- Links to relevant commands and workflow templates
- Maintains consistency with the intelligent-claude-code architecture

## Validation

This documentation has been created following the established patterns:
- Pure markdown format without automation concepts
- Behavioral guidance for manual processes
- Integration with virtual team @-notation
- Clear examples and practical guidance
- No references to software generators or automated systems

## Learning Applied

Based on previous learnings from TASK-003 and TASK-005:
- Focused on behavioral documentation, not software implementation
- Emphasized manual ID assignment process
- Avoided any automation or generator concepts
- Provided clear, actionable guidance for users and AI roles

## Next Steps

The ID conventions documentation is now available at:
`/docs/ID-CONVENTIONS.md`

This completes the documentation requirements for the ID formatting system, providing comprehensive guidance for all users and AI roles working with the intelligent-claude-code behavioral system.
