**Quality Assessment:** EXCELLENT - Documentation is clear and actionable.

## AI-Architect Validation

As the AI-Architect responsible for this AI behavioral system, I have conducted a comprehensive validation of STORY-014's implementation. This validation focuses on ensuring the documentation properly supports the intelligent-claude-code virtual team's AI behavioral architecture.

- No pollution from traditional software concepts (no generators, no daemons, no persistence)

✅ **Virtual Team Integration**
- ID formatting guide integrates seamlessly with @-notation role system
- Commands properly import the behavioral documentation
- Pseudo-code in commands demonstrates behavioral patterns, not software execution
- Role validation ensures proper specialist assignment (PM for story creation)

✅ **AI Workflow Support**
- Manual ID assignment process supports AI role decision-making
- Clear guidelines enable consistent behavior across all 14+ specialist roles
- Dynamic specialist creation can follow same ID patterns
- Workflow templates properly enforce validation gates for AI work

✅ **Markdown Architecture Compliance**
- Pure markdown documentation without environment variables or config files
- Import chain activation through @../behaviors/id-formatting-guide.md
- No build artifacts or compiled components
- Maintains Claude Code's native markdown support

✅ **Behavioral Clarity**
- Step-by-step process for ID assignment is clear and actionable
- Examples cover common scenarios (starting fresh, adding to existing, parallel work)
- Best practices guide AI roles in making consistent decisions
- Checklist provides systematic approach for ID assignment
