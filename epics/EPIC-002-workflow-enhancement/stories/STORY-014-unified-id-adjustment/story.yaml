  phase: "PLAN"
  
problem_statement: |
  The system currently uses a single unified ID sequence across all work items.
  This needs to be adjusted to use per-type sequential numbering:
  - EPICs: EPIC-001, EPIC-002, etc.
  - STORIEs: STORY-001, STORY-002, etc.
  - BUGs: BUG-001, BUG-002, etc.
  - Tasks: Numbered from 1 within their parent work item
  
  This provides better organization and clarity while maintaining uniqueness
  within each work item type.
  
user_story: |
  As a system user, I want work items to have per-type sequential IDs so that
  I can easily identify and organize work by type while maintaining clear
  numbering sequences.
  
business_value: |
  - Clearer work item organization
  - Easier identification by type
  - Simplified ID management
  - Better alignment with industry standards
  - Reduced cognitive load
