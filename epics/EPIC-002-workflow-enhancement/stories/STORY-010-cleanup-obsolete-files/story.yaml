problem_description: |
  CRITICAL SYSTEM ISSUE: The virtual team is importing old workflow files instead of corrected versions.
  
  CURRENT IMPORTS (WRONG):
  - outer-workflow.yaml (v1.0.0)
  - inner-workflow.yaml (v1.0.0)
  
  CORRECT FILES EXIST:
  - outer-workflow-corrected.yaml (v2.0.0)
  - inner-workflow-corrected.yaml (v2.0.0)
  
  PLUS: ~60KB of obsolete files in src/ that should be removed.
  
acceptance_criteria:
  - Virtual team imports correct workflow files (v2.0.0)
  - Old workflow files removed
  - Obsolete src/ files removed
  - System uses only required files
  - No duplicate/obsolete files remain
  
embedded_config:
  autonomy_level: "L3"
  pm_always_active: true
  blocking_enabled: false
  git_privacy: true
  
critical_files_to_fix:
  wrong_imports:
    - "outer-workflow.yaml (v1.0.0)" # WRONG - virtual team imports this
    - "inner-workflow.yaml (v1.0.0)" # WRONG - virtual team imports this
  correct_files:
    - "outer-workflow-corrected.yaml (v2.0.0)" # CORRECT - should be imported
    - "inner-workflow-corrected.yaml (v2.0.0)" # CORRECT - should be imported
    
obsolete_files_to_remove:
  planning_files:
    - "planning/workflow-enforcement-guide.md" # 3.4 KB - Enforcement removed
    - "planning/system-simplification.md" # 5.1 KB - Planning doc, not operational
    - "planning/commands-corrected.md" # 4.7 KB - Duplicate of commands/planning-commands.md
    - "planning/enhanced-planning-mode.md" # 7.8 KB - Complex planning replaced
    - "planning/capability-matcher.md" # 9.0 KB - Complex matching replaced
    - "planning/config-processor.md" # 12.9 KB - Complex processing replaced
    - "planning/review-findings-handler.md" # 7.5 KB - Complex review handling replaced
    - "planning/priority-system.md" # 3.9 KB - Planning document, implemented
  potentially_obsolete:
    - "learning-callouts.md" # 1.6 KB - May be unused
    - "scores.md" # 3.7 KB - May be replaced by badges.md
