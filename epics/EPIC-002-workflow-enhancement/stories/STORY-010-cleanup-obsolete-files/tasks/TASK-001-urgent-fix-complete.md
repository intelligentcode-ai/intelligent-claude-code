## CRITICAL FIX APPLIED

### Problem Fixed ✅
**BEFORE (WRONG):**
```markdown
@../../workflow-templates/outer-workflow.yaml        # v1.0.0
@../../workflow-templates/inner-workflow.yaml        # v1.0.0
```

**AFTER (CORRECT):**
```markdown
@../../workflow-templates/outer-workflow-corrected.yaml   # v2.0.0
@../../workflow-templates/inner-workflow-corrected.yaml   # v2.0.0
```

### Changes Made ✅
- Updated virtual-team.md to import corrected workflow files (v2.0.0)
- System now uses proper epic/story/bug/task terminology
- System now uses correct workflow logic

### Impact ✅
- **System integrity:** Fixed - now using correct workflow versions
- **Workflow logic:** Updated to v2.0.0 corrected versions
- **Terminology:** Now using proper EPIC→STORY→TASK hierarchy

## Critical Issue Resolved

The system was running on outdated workflow logic (v1.0.0) instead of the corrected versions (v2.0.0) that implement proper terminology and workflow patterns.

## Ready for Peer Review
