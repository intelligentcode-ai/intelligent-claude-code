problem_description: |
  The system contains outdated command patterns and inconsistent command prefixes.
  Some commands use old patterns while newer ones use "icc:" prefix. This creates
  confusion and maintenance issues. Need to standardize all commands to use the
  "icc:" prefix for consistency and clean up any deprecated command patterns.
