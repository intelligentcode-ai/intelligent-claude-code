# TASK-002 Integrate Commands with Validation System - COMPLETE

**Task:** Integrate commands with validation system  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Engineer  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 13:47:00

## Implementation Summary

Successfully integrated all commands with the lean-workflow-executor validation system.

## Integration Changes

### Validation Chain Integration
All commands now integrate with the validation pattern:
```yaml
icc:detect-work-type(content) 
→ icc:require-triage(@PM, @detected_specialist_architect) 
→ icc:validate-assignments(tasks) 
→ icc:require-approval(@PM, @detected_specialist_architect)
→ icc:create-assignment(story.yaml)
```

### Command Integration Updates
- **icc:accept-task** - Now validates through lean-workflow-executor ✅
- **icc:task-status** - Now reports through validation system ✅
- **icc:plan-task** - Now creates assignments through validation ✅

### Files Updated
1. `/src/planning/enhanced-planning-mode.md` - Added validation integration
2. `/src/planning/config-processor.md` - Updated command processing
3. `/src/behaviors/lean-workflow-executor.md` - Enhanced validation patterns

## Validation System Features
- **Work Type Detection** - Automatically detects AI/infrastructure work
- **Triage Requirement** - Enforces PM + Specialist Architect collaboration
- **Assignment Validation** - Validates role assignments and capability matching
- **Approval Workflow** - Requires joint approval for work execution

## Ready for Peer Review
**Assigned to:** @AI-Architect (SME for validation system architecture)
**Review Requirements:** Validate integration patterns and system compatibility
