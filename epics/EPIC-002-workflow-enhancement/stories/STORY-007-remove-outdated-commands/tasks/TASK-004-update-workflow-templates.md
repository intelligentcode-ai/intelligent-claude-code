# TASK-004: Update Workflow Templates with Command Changes

**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Engineer  
**Story:** STORY-007 Remove Outdated Commands  
**Priority:** P1  
**Dependencies:** TASK-003

## Task Description

Update all workflow templates to use consistent command patterns with icc: prefix.

## Files Checked

### Primary Workflow Templates
1. `workflow-templates/outer-workflow.yaml` 
2. `workflow-templates/inner-workflow.yaml`
3. `workflow-templates/examples/*.yaml`
4. `workflow-templates/README.md`
5. `workflow-templates/INTEGRATION.md`

## Execution Log

### Search for Slash Commands
- Performed comprehensive search for slash command patterns in all workflow template files
- Used multiple grep patterns to find `/command-name` style references
- Searched for quoted slash commands and command contexts

### Search Results
- **No slash command references found** in any workflow template files
- All forward slashes found were in legitimate contexts:
  - File paths (e.g., `workflow-templates/outer-workflow.yaml`)
  - Directory structures (e.g., `test/fixtures`)
  - Technical terms (e.g., `CI/CD`)
  - YAML structure references (e.g., `story/bug`)
  - Git branch examples (e.g., `story/STORY-001-user-authentication`)

### Validation Commands Present
The workflow templates already contain proper icc: prefixed commands:
- `icc:detect-work-type(task_content)`
- `icc:require-triage(pm_role, specialist_architect)`
- `icc:validate-assignments(task, proposed_role)`
- `icc:require-approval(pm_role, specialist_architect)`

### Findings Summary
- **Workflow templates are already consistent** with icc: prefix standard
- **No outdated slash commands** were found in any workflow template files
- **All command references use proper icc: format** as expected
- **No updates required** for workflow templates

## Conclusion

All workflow template files already use the correct icc: command format. No slash commands were found that needed conversion. The workflow templates are fully compliant with the command standardization requirements.
