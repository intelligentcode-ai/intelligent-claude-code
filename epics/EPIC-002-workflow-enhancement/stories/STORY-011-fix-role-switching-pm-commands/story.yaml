  CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURES:
  
  1. ROLE SWITCHING DOESN'T WORK
  - System talks about "@Role switching" but doesn't actually switch roles
  - Roles are mentioned but not activated
  - No actual role behavior change occurs
  
  2. PM COMMANDS MISSING
  - @PM init command missing
  - @PM refresh command missing  
  - @PM reset command missing
  - System management commands disappeared
  
acceptance_criteria:
  - Role switching actually changes active role and expertise
  - When @Role is assigned, system becomes that role
  - @PM init, @PM refresh, @PM reset commands restored
  - System management commands functional
  - Role behavior actually changes with assignments

  role_switching:

  pm_commands:
    missing_commands:
      - "@PM init" # Initialize/reset system state
      - "@PM refresh" # Refresh team capabilities and configuration
      - "@PM reset" # Reset system to clean state
    current_behavior: "Commands don't exist"
    required_behavior: "System management commands functional"
    impact: "No way to properly initialize or manage system"
