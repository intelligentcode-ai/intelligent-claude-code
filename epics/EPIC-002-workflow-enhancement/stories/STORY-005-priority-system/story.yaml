problem_description: |
  The system currently treats the LAST item as highest priority, which is
  conceptually and contextually wrong. We need a proper priority system
  that flows from Epic → Story/Bug → Task with clear execution order.
  
acceptance_criteria:
  - Priority levels defined for epics, stories/bugs, and tasks
  - Priority inheritance from parent items
  - Execution follows priority order (P0 first, not last)
  - Commands show items sorted by priority
  - Dynamic priority adjustment supported
  
embedded_config:
  # From config.md - ALL settings that affect priority system
  autonomy_level: "L3"
  pm_always_active: true
  memory_integration: true
  blocking_enabled: false  # Affects review task priority
  git_privacy: true
  requirements_engineer_mandatory: true  # Affects task creation
  architecture_review_required: true  # Creates high-priority review tasks
  enforce_peer_review: true  # Creates review tasks
  testing_required: true  # Creates test tasks
  security_validation: true  # Creates P0 security tasks

integration_requirements:
  - Priority must flow: Epic → Story/Bug → Task
  - P0 executes first, not last
  - Blocking tasks before parallel tasks
  - Security issues always P0
  - Customer bugs escalate priority
  
technical_references:
  - Current wrong behavior: Last item = highest priority
  - Correct behavior: P0 → P1 → P2 → P3
  - Task priority types: blocking, critical_path, parallel, optional
  - Bug severity mapping: CRITICAL→P0, HIGH→P1, MEDIUM→P2, LOW→P3
  
tasks:
  # Will be created during PLAN phase with proper priority assignments
