# TASK-001 Design Priority System Architecture - IN PROGRESS

**Task:** Design Priority System Architecture  
**Assigned to:** @AI-Architect  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 12:55:00

## Architecture Overview

The priority system addresses the critical flaw where the system treats the LAST item as highest priority instead of P0 being first. This architecture defines a hierarchical priority system with inheritance and proper execution order.

## Priority Level Definitions

### Epic Priorities
```yaml
P0: CRITICAL    # System-breaking issues, security vulnerabilities
P1: HIGH        # Major features, important bugs
P2: MEDIUM      # Standard features, minor bugs  
P3: LOW         # Nice-to-have features, documentation
```

### Story/Bug Priorities
```yaml
Inheritance: Epic priority + severity adjustment
P0: CRITICAL bugs, security issues, system-breaking changes
P1: HIGH bugs, major features, architecture changes
P2: MEDIUM bugs, standard features, improvements
P3: LOW bugs, minor features, documentation updates
```

### Task Priorities
```yaml
blocking:       Must complete before other tasks can start
critical_path:  On critical path, affects delivery timeline
parallel:       Can run simultaneously with other tasks
optional:       Can be skipped if time constraints
```

## Priority Inheritance Rules

### Epic → Story/Bug
```yaml
Story Priority = MAX(Epic Priority, Story Severity)

Examples:
- P2 Epic + CRITICAL bug → P0 Story
- P1 Epic + HIGH feature → P1 Story  
- P0 Epic + MEDIUM bug → P0 Story (inherits epic priority)
```

### Story/Bug → Task
```yaml
Task Priority = Story Priority + Task Type Adjustment

Adjustments:
- Security tasks: Always P0 (security_validation: true)
- Architecture review: +1 priority level (architecture_review_required: true)
- Blocking tasks: Execute before parallel tasks
- Testing tasks: Same as story priority
```

## Execution Order Logic

### Current Problem
```yaml
BROKEN: Last item = highest priority
Result: P3 items execute before P0 items
Impact: System unusable for real work
```

### Correct Implementation
```yaml
CORRECT: P0 → P1 → P2 → P3
Sort Order: Ascending priority value (P0=0, P1=1, P2=2, P3=3)
Within Same Priority: blocking → critical_path → parallel → optional
```

## Priority System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Priority Calculator
```yaml
Location: src/behaviors/lean-workflow-executor.md
Function: calculatePriority(item, parent)
Logic:
  - Epic priority inheritance
  - Severity mapping
  - Type adjustments
  - Dynamic escalation
```

#### 2. Priority Sorter
```yaml
Location: src/behaviors/lean-workflow-executor.md
Function: sortByPriority(items)
Algorithm:
  - Primary sort: Priority level (P0 first)
  - Secondary sort: Task type (blocking first)
  - Tertiary sort: Creation time (FIFO)
```

#### 3. Priority Display
```yaml
Location: TodoWrite integration
Function: displayWithPriority(items)
Format: "[P0] @Role: Task description"
Highlighting: P0 items highlighted, P3 items dimmed
```

### Integration Points

#### 1. Workflow Templates
```yaml
outer-workflow-corrected.yaml:
  - Add priority calculation during story creation
  - Sort stories by priority before task creation
  - Inherit epic priority for all stories

inner-workflow-corrected.yaml:
  - Add priority sorting for task execution
  - Display priority in task status
  - Respect priority in parallel execution
```

#### 2. TodoWrite System
```yaml
Priority Display:
  - Show priority prefix: [P0], [P1], [P2], [P3]
  - Sort todo items by priority
  - Group by priority level
  - Color coding for priority levels
```

#### 3. Assignment System
```yaml
Role Assignment:
  - P0 tasks assigned to most capable specialist
  - Security tasks always assigned to @Security-Engineer
  - Architecture tasks assigned to @AI-Architect for AI work
  - Blocking tasks assigned to available specialists
```

## Dynamic Priority Rules

### Escalation Triggers
```yaml
Security Issues: Automatically escalate to P0
Customer Bugs: Escalate priority by 1 level
Blocking Dependencies: Escalate to critical_path
System Failures: Escalate to P0
```

### De-escalation Triggers
```yaml
Resolved Dependencies: Lower priority if no longer blocking
Scope Reduction: Lower priority if scope reduced
Timeline Extension: Lower priority if timeline extended
```

## Configuration Integration

### Embedded Config Impact
```yaml
security_validation: true → Creates P0 security tasks
architecture_review_required: true → Creates high-priority review tasks
requirements_engineer_mandatory: true → Affects task creation priority
enforce_peer_review: true → Creates review tasks with story priority
blocking_enabled: false → Affects how priority conflicts are resolved
```

### Priority-Driven Behavior
```yaml
L3 Autonomy: Execute highest priority items first
Team Collaboration: Priority conflicts resolved through team support
Memory Integration: Store priority patterns for learning
Configuration Driven: Priority behavior adapts to team settings
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Priority Logic
1. Implement priority calculation functions
2. Add priority sorting algorithms
3. Fix execution order (P0 first, not last)
4. Add priority inheritance logic

### Phase 2: Integration
1. Update workflow templates with priority support
2. Integrate with TodoWrite for priority display
3. Add priority to assignment system
4. Implement dynamic priority adjustment

### Phase 3: Validation
1. Test priority inheritance
2. Validate execution order
3. Test dynamic priority adjustment
4. Verify integration with all systems

## Error Handling

### Priority Conflicts
```yaml
Same Priority: Use task type (blocking > critical_path > parallel > optional)
Missing Priority: Default to P2 (medium)
Invalid Priority: Log error, default to P2
Circular Dependencies: Break cycle using creation time
```

### System Failures
```yaml
Priority Calculation Error: Fall back to creation time ordering
Sort Algorithm Error: Use simple alphabetical sort
Display Error: Show items without priority prefix
Integration Error: Continue with default priority
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
```yaml
Priority Caching: Cache calculated priorities to avoid recalculation
Lazy Sorting: Sort only when needed for display/execution
Batch Updates: Update priorities in batches, not individually
Index Optimization: Index items by priority for fast retrieval
```

### Scalability
```yaml
Large Item Lists: Use efficient sorting algorithms (O(n log n))
Frequent Updates: Minimize priority recalculation
Memory Usage: Store only essential priority information
Network Impact: Minimize priority synchronization overhead
```

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Requirements
```yaml
Priority Calculation: Test all inheritance scenarios
Execution Order: Verify P0 executes before P1/P2/P3
Dynamic Adjustment: Test escalation and de-escalation
Integration: Test with all workflow components
Edge Cases: Test missing priorities, invalid values, conflicts
```

### Validation Criteria
```yaml
Correctness: Priority order matches expected behavior
Performance: Priority operations complete within 100ms
Consistency: Priority behavior consistent across all components
Usability: Priority display clear and informative
Reliability: Priority system handles errors gracefully
```

## Migration Strategy

### Current State Analysis
```yaml
Problem: Last item treated as highest priority
Impact: P3 items execute before P0 items
Root Cause: Incorrect sort order in execution logic
Dependencies: Affects all workflow components
```

### Migration Steps
```yaml
1. Identify current priority logic location
2. Fix sort order (ascending, not descending)
3. Add priority calculation functions
4. Update workflow templates
5. Test with existing items
6. Deploy with validation
```

### Rollback Plan
```yaml
Rollback Trigger: Priority system causes execution failures
Rollback Action: Revert to creation time ordering
Validation: Ensure all items continue to execute
Recovery: Fix priority issues and redeploy
```

## Success Metrics

### Functional Success
```yaml
- P0 items execute before P1/P2/P3 items
- Priority inheritance works correctly
- Dynamic priority adjustment functions
- Integration with all workflow components
- Error handling prevents system failures
```

### Performance Success
```yaml
- Priority calculation completes in <50ms
- Sort operations complete in <100ms
- Memory usage increase <10%
- No performance degradation in workflow execution
```

### User Experience Success
```yaml
- Priority display is clear and informative
- Priority behavior is predictable and consistent
- Priority conflicts are resolved automatically
- System remains responsive during priority operations
```
