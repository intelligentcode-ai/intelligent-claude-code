## Documentation Updates Summary

Successfully updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive priority system documentation, including the critical execution order fix, priority inheritance rules, and complete usage guidelines.

## Major Documentation Updates

### 1. Priority System Section Added
```markdown
### Priority System
- **Execution Order**: P0 → P1 → P2 → P3 (FIXED: was last item = highest priority)
- **Priority Inheritance**: Epic → Story → Task with severity and type adjustments
- **Dynamic Escalation**: Security issues and system failures automatically escalate to P0
- **Display Format**: TodoWrite shows [P0], [P1], [P2], [P3] prefixes with visual prioritization
- **Scoring Bonuses**: P0 (+2.0P), P1 (+1.5P), P2 (+1.0P), P3 (+0.5P) for completion
- **Task Type Priority**: blocking → critical_path → parallel → optional within same priority
```

### 2. Priority Levels Documentation
```bash
# Epic/Story/Bug Priorities
P0: CRITICAL - System-breaking issues, security vulnerabilities
P1: HIGH - Major features, important bugs
P2: MEDIUM - Standard features, minor bugs
P3: LOW - Nice-to-have features, documentation

# Task Priorities (within same story priority)
blocking: Must complete before other tasks can start
critical_path: On critical path, affects delivery timeline
parallel: Can run simultaneously with other tasks
optional: Can be skipped if time constraints
```

### 3. Priority Inheritance Rules
```bash
# Epic → Story
Story Priority = MAX(Epic Priority, Story Severity Priority)

# Story → Task
Task Priority = Story Priority + Task Type Adjustments

# Automatic Escalations
Security work → P0 (automatic)
Customer bugs → Priority +1 level
System failures → P0 (automatic)
Blocking dependencies → critical_path priority
```
