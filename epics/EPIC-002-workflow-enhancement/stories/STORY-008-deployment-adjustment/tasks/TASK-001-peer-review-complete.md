# TASK-001 Peer Review - COMPLETE

**Task:** Peer Review of Deployment Configuration Audit  
**Assigned to:** @System-Architect  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 13:58:00

## Review Summary

**APPROVED** - Deployment audit correctly identifies system is already lean.

## Review Findings

### Architecture Assessment ✅
- Deployment entry point correctly uses lean virtual team
- Virtual team imports reduced to 6 lean components (validated from BUG-002)
- Startup sequence properly configured for lean workflow executor
- No old behavioral enforcement modules active

### Analysis Accuracy ✅
- Correct identification that BUG-002 already cleaned up deployment
- Proper validation of current lean system status
- Accurate assessment of startup sequence
- Correct conclusion that no changes needed

### System Validation ✅
- `/CLAUDE.md` entry point verified
- `/src/modes/virtual-team.md` imports validated
- Startup sequence confirmed lean
- Assignment-driven workflow active

## Architecture Review

### Current State Validation ✅
- **Main Entry:** `@~/.claude/modes/virtual-team.md` ✅
- **Imports:** 6 lean components only ✅
- **Startup:** Lean workflow executor ✅
- **Old Modules:** Removed in BUG-002 ✅

### System Boot Sequence ✅
The documented startup sequence is correct:
1. Config Load → Apply to workflow context ✅
2. Memory Bootstrap → Load state ✅
3. Role Definitions → Load specialist roles ✅
4. Workflow Engine → Activate lean workflow executor ✅
5. Scoring System → Initialize badges.md scoring ✅
6. Learning System → Activate learning-team-automation.md ✅
7. Assignment Reading → Ready to read story/task files ✅

## Implications

### STORY-008 Impact
The audit reveals that STORY-008 may be redundant since:
- Deployment is already lean
- Virtual team already uses lean components
- System boots with lean workflow executor
- No old enforcement patterns active

### Recommendation
Consider marking STORY-008 as "ALREADY_RESOLVED" similar to STORY-006, or refocus on validation/documentation of current lean state.

## Approval

**PEER REVIEW APPROVED** - Deployment audit is thorough and accurately identifies current lean system state.
