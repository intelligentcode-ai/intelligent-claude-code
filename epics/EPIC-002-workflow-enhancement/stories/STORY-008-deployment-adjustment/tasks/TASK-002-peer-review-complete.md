# TASK-002 Peer Review - COMPLETE

**Task:** Peer Review of Virtual Team Imports Verification  
**Assigned to:** @System-Architect  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 14:00:00

## Review Summary

**APPROVED** - Virtual team imports verification confirms lean system is already active.

## Review Findings

### Architecture Validation ✅
- Virtual team imports correctly reduced to 6 lean components
- All old behavioral enforcement modules removed
- Lean workflow executor properly integrated
- Assignment-driven workflow active

### Historical Context Verification ✅
- BUG-002 TASK-003 already completed virtual team updates
- Transition from 19 complex to 6 lean imports verified
- Scoring and learning systems preserved as required
- No regression to old complex system

### Current State Assessment ✅
- **Import Count:** 6 lean components ✅
- **Startup Sequence:** Lean workflow executor ✅
- **Operation Mode:** Assignment-driven workflow ✅
- **Old Modules:** Properly removed ✅

## Architecture Review

### Component Validation ✅
All 6 imports are correct for lean system:
1. **specialists.md** - Clean role definitions without enforcement
2. **lean-workflow-executor.md** - Core lean execution engine
3. **learning-team-automation.md** - Essential learning system
4. **badges.md** - Scoring and recognition system
5. **outer-workflow.yaml** - Story/epic workflow patterns
6. **inner-workflow.yaml** - Task execution patterns

### System Integration ✅
- Clean separation from old complex system
- Proper lean workflow activation
- Assignment file processing ready
- No conflicts with lean principles

## Implications

### STORY-008 Status
Tasks 1-2 confirm the system is already lean:
- Deployment configuration correct
- Virtual team imports correct
- System boots with lean workflow executor
- No old enforcement patterns active

### Recommendation
STORY-008 should be marked as "ALREADY_RESOLVED" - the deployment adjustment described in the story has already been completed through previous work (primarily BUG-002).

## Approval

**PEER REVIEW APPROVED** - Virtual team imports verification confirms lean system deployment is already active.
