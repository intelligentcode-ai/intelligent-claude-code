# TASK-002 Update Virtual Team Imports - COMPLETE

**Task:** Update virtual team imports  
**Assigned to:** @System-Engineer  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 13:59:00

## Virtual Team Imports Assessment

### Current Import Analysis

#### `/src/modes/virtual-team.md` Current Imports
```markdown
@../roles/specialists.md
@../behaviors/lean-workflow-executor.md
@../behaviors/learning-team-automation.md
@badges.md
@../../workflow-templates/outer-workflow.yaml
@../../workflow-templates/inner-workflow.yaml
```

### Verification Results

#### ✅ IMPORTS ALREADY LEAN
- **Total imports:** 6 lean components
- **Old behavioral modules:** Already removed in BUG-002
- **Complex enforcement:** Already eliminated
- **Workflow-driven:** Already active

#### ✅ COMPONENTS VERIFIED
1. **`@../roles/specialists.md`** - Clean role definitions ✅
2. **`@../behaviors/lean-workflow-executor.md`** - Lean executor only ✅
3. **`@../behaviors/learning-team-automation.md`** - Learning system ✅
4. **`@badges.md`** - Scoring system ✅
5. **`@../../workflow-templates/outer-workflow.yaml`** - Outer workflow ✅
6. **`@../../workflow-templates/inner-workflow.yaml`** - Inner workflow ✅

### Historical Context

#### BUG-002 Already Completed This Work
From BUG-002 TASK-003 completion:
- Updated virtual-team.md imports from 19 complex to 6 lean
- Removed all enforcement modules
- Preserved scoring and learning systems
- Activated lean workflow executor

### Current State Validation

#### System Architecture ✅
- **Entry Point:** `/CLAUDE.md` → `@~/.claude/modes/virtual-team.md` ✅
- **Virtual Team:** Uses 6 lean components only ✅
- **Startup:** Lean workflow executor activation ✅
- **Operation:** Assignment-driven workflow ✅

## Conclusion

**VIRTUAL TEAM IMPORTS ALREADY CORRECT** - No changes needed. BUG-002 already:
- Reduced imports from 19 complex to 6 lean components
- Removed all old behavioral enforcement modules
- Preserved essential scoring and learning systems
- Activated lean workflow executor

## Ready for Peer Review
**Assigned to:** @System-Architect (SME for virtual team architecture)
**Review Requirements:** Validate virtual team imports are correct for lean system
