problem_statement: |
  CRITICAL EFFICIENCY ISSUE: The system claims to be "LEAN" but evidence suggests 
  excessive token consumption that contradicts this claim. Current inefficiencies:
  
  1. **Excessive File Reading**: Full files loaded when only specific sections needed
  2. **Redundant Tool Calls**: Multiple reads of same files in single session
  3. **Verbose Behavioral Patterns**: Overly detailed pseudocode blocks
  4. **Unnecessary Context Loading**: Loading entire behavioral files for simple operations
  5. **Inefficient Search Patterns**: Broad searches when targeted queries would suffice
  6. **Bloated Responses**: System generates verbose outputs consuming tokens
  7. **Duplicate Information**: Same concepts repeated across multiple files
  
  Token consumption analysis:
  - Average file read: 500-2000 tokens (could be 50-200 with selective loading)
  - Behavioral file loads: 5000-10000 tokens each (most unused)
  - Search operations: 1000-3000 tokens (could be 100-500 with better patterns)
  - Response generation: Often 2-3x longer than necessary
  
  The system is NOT lean. It's token-hungry and inefficient.
  
user_story: |
  As a developer using intelligent-claude-code, I want a truly LEAN system that 
  minimizes token usage while maintaining 100% of current functionality, so that 
  I can work on larger projects without constantly hitting context limits.
  
business_value: |
  - **70% reduction in token usage** while maintaining all features
  - Extended context window availability for actual work
  - Reduced operational costs from lower token consumption
  - Faster response times from loading less context
  - True "lean" system as originally promised
  - Scalability to handle larger projects
  
project_scope: |
  Comprehensive optimization of the intelligent-claude-code system to minimize token 
  usage across all operations while maintaining complete functionality.
