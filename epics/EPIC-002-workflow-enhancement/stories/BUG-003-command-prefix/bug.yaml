bug_description: |
  All new commands are missing the required 'icc:' prefix, making them
  inconsistent with the existing command system and potentially causing
  conflicts.
  
reproduction_steps:
  - Look at new commands like /create-epic, /plan-story
  - Notice: Missing icc: prefix
  - Compare: Existing commands use icc:
  
expected_behavior: |
  All commands should be prefixed with icc:
  Example: icc:create-epic, icc:plan-story
  
actual_behavior: |
  New commands lack proper prefix
  Inconsistent with existing system
  
impact_analysis:
  affected_users: "All users"
  frequency: "Always"
  business_impact: "Confusion and potential conflicts"
  workaround: "Manual prefix addition"
  
root_cause_analysis: |
  Oversight during new command creation
  Did not follow established naming convention
  
resolution_criteria:
  - All commands have icc: prefix
  - Documentation updated
  - No unprefixed commands remain
  - Commands integrated with lean executor
  
embedded_config:
  autonomy_level: "L3"
  pm_always_active: true
  blocking_enabled: false
  git_privacy: true
  
affected_files:
  - "src/planning/commands-corrected.md"  # Has wrong prefixes
  - "src/planning/enhanced-planning-mode.md"  # /plan-task should be icc:plan-task
  - Any new command documentation
  
correct_command_examples:
  wrong:
    - "/create-epic"
    - "/plan-story"
    - "/execute-task"
    - "/complete-story"
  correct:
    - "icc:create-epic"
    - "icc:plan-story"
    - "icc:execute-task"
    - "icc:complete-story"
    
integration_with_lean_executor:
  - Commands should trigger lean-workflow-executor
  - Not old behavioral enforcement
  - Commands read assignment files
  - Commands update progress in files
  
tasks:
  # Will be created during PLAN phase
