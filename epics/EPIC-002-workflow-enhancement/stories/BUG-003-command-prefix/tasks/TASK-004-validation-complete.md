# TASK-004 Validate Command Integration - COMPLETE

**Task:** Validate command integration  
**Assigned to:** @QA-Engineer  
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2025-07-15 13:37:00

## Validation Summary

Successfully validated that all commands with icc: prefix integrate correctly with the lean-workflow-executor system.

## Integration Testing

### Command Consistency Check ✅
- All commands now consistently use icc: prefix
- No mixed prefix usage found
- Command naming follows standard pattern

### Lean Workflow Executor Integration ✅
- Commands reference lean-workflow-executor properly
- Assignment file pattern integration working
- Task execution flow validated

### Documentation Consistency ✅
- All documentation uses icc: prefix consistently
- Usage examples match implementation
- Command chains properly documented

## Validated Commands

### Core Planning Commands
- ✅ `icc:plan-task` - Integrates with lean executor
- ✅ `icc:execute-task` - Loads assignment files correctly
- ✅ `icc:accept-task` - Validates completion criteria
- ✅ `icc:task-status` - Shows proper status information

### Extended Command Set
- ✅ `icc:create-epic` - Creates epic structure
- ✅ `icc:plan-epic` - Plans epic breakdown  
- ✅ `icc:create-story` - Creates story files
- ✅ `icc:create-bug` - Creates bug reports
- ✅ `icc:plan-story` - Plans story tasks
- ✅ `icc:plan-bug` - Plans bug resolution
- ✅ `icc:assign-task` - Assigns to specialists
- ✅ `icc:create-subtask` - Creates subtask breakdown
- ✅ `icc:story-status` - Shows story progress
- ✅ `icc:epic-status` - Shows epic progress
- ✅ `icc:complete-task` - Marks task complete
- ✅ `icc:complete-story` - Marks story complete
- ✅ `icc:resolve-bug` - Resolves bug reports

## Integration Validation

### Lean Workflow Executor Compatibility
- ✅ Commands trigger lean-workflow-executor functions
- ✅ Assignment file reading/writing works
- ✅ Progress tracking integrated
- ✅ Scoring system integration functional

### Command Chaining
- ✅ `icc:plan-task → icc:execute-task → icc:accept-task` flow validated
- ✅ Error handling chain `icc:accept-task (failed) → icc:plan-task (refinement)` working
- ✅ All command transitions properly documented

## Test Results

All 17 commands with icc: prefix have been validated for:
- Consistent naming convention ✅
- Proper documentation ✅
- Lean workflow executor integration ✅
- Command chaining functionality ✅

## Next Steps

Ready for TASK-005 deployment of all command prefix fixes.
