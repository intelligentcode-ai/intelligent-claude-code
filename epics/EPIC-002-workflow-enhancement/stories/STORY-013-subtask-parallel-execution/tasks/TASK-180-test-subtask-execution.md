# TASK-180: Test subtask parallel execution

## Task Metadata
- **ID**: TASK-180
- **Title**: @QA-Engineer: Test subtask parallel execution
- **Assigned To**: @QA-Engineer
- **Type**: testing
- **Priority**: critical_path
- **Status**: completed
- **Story**: STORY-013
- **Dependencies**: ["TASK-177", "TASK-178", "TASK-179"]

## Task Scope
Test the subtask execution system that has been implemented in STORY-013. This includes verifying that all tasks are executed as subtasks using Claude Code's Task tool with proper role names in titles.

## Execution Instructions
0. Ensure dependencies are completed: TASK-177, TASK-178, TASK-179
1. Review implementation to understand functionality
2. Create unit tests for all functions
3. Add integration tests for workflows
4. Ensure edge cases are covered
5. Validate error handling

## Required Information
- **Parent story**: Implement mandatory subtask execution with parallelization
- **Acceptance Criteria**: See parent story
- **Dependencies**: TASK-177, TASK-178, TASK-179 must be completed first

## Embedded Config
```yaml
execution_mode: testing
test_framework: behavioral_validation
parallel_eligible: false
execution_priority: high
model: sonnet
```

## Success Criteria
- All critical paths have test coverage
- Tests are passing
- Edge cases are covered
- Tests are maintainable
- Coverage meets team standards

## Implementation Details
**Test Categories:**
- Subtask Execution via Task Tool
- Parallel Execution
- Model Selection
- Task File Integration
- Role Assignment in Subtasks

**Test Approach:**
- Code review of implementation
- Behavioral validation
- Integration testing
- Documentation review

## Output Location
- Test results in tasks/TASK-180-test-results.md
- Test execution documented in this file
- Validation results in story.yaml acceptance criteria

## Execution Context
This task will be executed via Claude Code's Task tool as a subtask.
The PM will delegate this to @QA-Engineer who will read this file for complete context.

**Model Selection**: This task will use the 'sonnet' model for execution.

## Completion Details
- **Completed At**: 2025-07-18 11:00:00
- **Completed By**: @QA-Engineer
- **Output**: All 15 tests passed. System ready for production use.
- **Test Results**: See TASK-180-test-results.md for detailed findings

### Summary
Successfully validated the subtask execution system with comprehensive testing:
- ✅ All non-PM tasks execute as subtasks using Task.create()
- ✅ Parallel execution fully implemented for non-conflicting tasks
- ✅ Model hierarchy working correctly (PM default, specialists Sonnet, complex Opus)
- ✅ Every task has dedicated .md file with complete context
- ✅ Role assignments clear in all subtask descriptions

The system is ready for production use with all critical requirements implemented and tested.
