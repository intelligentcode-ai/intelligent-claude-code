  Search memory and codebase for patterns related to subtask execution,
  parallel task execution, delegation patterns, Sonnet model usage,
  PM coordination patterns, and async execution patterns.
  
objectives:
  - Search memory for existing patterns
  - Search codebase for implementations
  - Document findings in structured format
  - Update task status to completed
  
prerequisites:
  - Access to memory system
  - Access to codebase
  - Understanding of parallel execution patterns
  
# Knowledge retrieval findings
knowledge_retrieved:
  - source: "Memory search - subtask/parallel/delegation"
    insight: "No existing memory entries found for subtask patterns"
    
  - source: "Codebase - lean-workflow-executor.md"
    insight: |
      Contains task execution patterns but no subtask delegation.
      Has parallel execution concepts in L3 mode:
      - executeTaskAsync() for non-blocking execution
      - Multiple tasks in state.currentTasks array
      - But no actual subtask delegation to Sonnet
      
  - source: "Codebase - l3-continuous-engine.md"
    insight: |
      L3 engine has parallel execution infrastructure:
      - getAvailableTasks(maxTasks: 5) for parallel work
      - executeTaskAsync() for concurrent execution
      - state.currentTasks tracks multiple executing tasks
      - Missing: Actual subtask delegation mechanism
      
  - source: "Codebase - task-queue-manager.md"
    insight: |
      Has sophisticated parallel task detection:
      - getParallelTasks() identifies non-conflicting work
      - hasConflict() checks resource/role conflicts
      - Priority-based task scheduling
      - Missing: Subtask execution implementation
      
  - source: "Codebase - STORY-013 requirements"
    insight: |
      Critical requirements identified:
      1. EVERY task as SUBTASK (except PM)
      2. Parallel execution for priority: "parallel"
      3. Async for non-dependent tasks
      4. Each subtask handles ONE task file
      5. Sonnet model for all subtasks
      6. PM stays in main context
      
  - source: "Task template analysis"
    insight: |
      Task files contain all needed information:
      - Complete task definition and context
      - Prerequisites and dependencies
      - Technical approach section
      - Deliverables specification
      - Can be passed to subtask for execution

findings_summary: |
  ## Current State Analysis
  
  1. **No Existing Subtask Implementation**
     - System has parallel execution infrastructure
     - But NO actual subtask delegation to Sonnet
     - All execution happens in main context currently
     
  2. **Parallel Execution Infrastructure Exists**
     - L3 engine supports concurrent task tracking
     - Task queue manager identifies parallel opportunities
     - Missing: Actual subtask spawning mechanism
     
  3. **Task Files Are Subtask-Ready**
     - Complete task definitions in YAML
     - Self-contained with all context
     - Perfect for passing to subtasks
     
  4. **Gap Analysis**
     - NEED: Subtask delegation mechanism
     - NEED: Sonnet model integration
     - NEED: PM coordination protocol
     - NEED: Result aggregation from subtasks
     
  5. **Implementation Path Clear**
     - Leverage existing parallel infrastructure
     - Add subtask delegation layer
     - Use task files as subtask input
     - PM orchestrates from main context
