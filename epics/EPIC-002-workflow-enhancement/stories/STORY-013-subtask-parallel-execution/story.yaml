problem_statement: |
  CRITICAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENT: All tasks must be executed as SUBTASKS using
  Sonnet model, with parallel execution for non-dependent tasks. Only PM tasks
  run in main context - ALL other tasks are delegated as subtasks.
  
  Requirements:
  1. EVERY task executed as SUBTASK (except PM coordination)
  2. Parallel execution for tasks with priority: "parallel"
  3. Async execution for non-dependent tasks
  4. Each subtask handles ONE task from task file
  5. Sonnet model used for all subtask execution
  6. PM remains in main context for coordination only
  7. EVERY task must have DEDICATED task file (.md) with clear scope and settings
  8. Task files provide executing role with required information and embedded config
  
user_story: |
  As a system user, I want ALL tasks to be executed as subtasks with proper
  parallelization, so that the virtual team operates efficiently with true
  multi-role parallel execution as designed.
  
business_value: |
  - 5x faster task execution through parallelization
  - True virtual team collaboration
  - Proper role isolation through subtasks
  - Efficient resource utilization
  - L3 autonomous execution realized
