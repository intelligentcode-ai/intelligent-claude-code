description: |
  Transform the virtual team system from complex behavioral enforcement to a
  lean workflow-driven approach where the workflow IS the behavior. Create a
  system that is LEAN, DEPENDABLE, ADJUSTABLE, LEARNING, and AUTONOMOUS.
  
goals:
  - Replace behavioral complexity with workflow simplicity
  - Make assignment files the single source of truth
  - Enable atomic task execution
  - Support project-specific customization
  - Ensure subtask completion enforcement

success_criteria:
  - Workflow drives all behavior without behavioral prompts
  - Phase transitions blocked without subtask completion
  - Process definitions are modular and referenceable
  - System distinguishes REFINE from NEW automatically
  - Reduced context size by 80%
  
principles:
  - LEAN: Minimal components, maximum effect
  - DEPENDABLE: Workflow structure ensures consistency
  - ADJUSTABLE: Project-specific processes supported
  - LEARNING: Captures patterns and improvements
  - AUTONOMOUS: Self-executing based on assignment files
