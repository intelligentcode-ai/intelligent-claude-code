# [AI-Architect] Clean up behaviors to focus on enforcement

**ID:** TASK-117-003
**Bug:** BUG-117
**Status:** PLANNED
**Assigned:** @AI-Architect
**Priority:** P1

## Description
Behavioral files contain too much implementation logic. They should focus on enforcement and mandatory requirements, with actual logic consolidated in workflow or shared patterns.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Review all behavioral files for implementation logic
- [ ] Extract implementation to appropriate locations
- [ ] Refactor behaviors to pure enforcement focus
- [ ] Update import chains to maintain functionality
- [ ] Document clear purpose of each behavior file

## Acceptance Criteria
- Behaviors contain ONLY enforcement rules
- Implementation logic moved to workflow/patterns
- Each behavior file < 50 lines
- Clear single purpose per behavior
- Maintained system functionality

## Technical Notes
- Behaviors should be "MUST do X" + auto-correct
- Not "HOW to do X" (that's workflow)
- Keep mandatory headers and core rules
- Remove detailed implementation steps
