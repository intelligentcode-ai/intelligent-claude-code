# [AI-Architect] Fix user interaction in workflow - cannot happen in subagents

**ID:** TASK-117-001
**Bug:** BUG-117
**Status:** PLANNED
**Assigned:** @AI-Architect
**Priority:** P0

## Description
The executable-workflow.md incorrectly shows user interaction happening inside subagents. Subagents execute autonomously and cannot interact with users. All user interaction must happen at the parent/orchestrator level.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Identify all instances of user interaction in subagent contexts
- [ ] Move user interaction logic to parent orchestrator level
- [ ] Update workflow to show correct interaction flow
- [ ] Ensure subagents only return results to parent
- [ ] Add clear documentation about subagent limitations

## Acceptance Criteria
- No user interaction shown in subagent execution
- Parent handles all user communication
- Workflow accurately reflects system architecture
- Clear separation between orchestration and execution

## Technical Notes
- Subagents created via Task tool execute independently
- Only parent can use user-facing tools
- Results flow: subagent → parent → user
