# [AI-Architect] Consolidate repetitive content across system

**ID:** TASK-117-002
**Bug:** BUG-117
**Status:** PLANNED
**Assigned:** @AI-Architect
**Priority:** P0

## Description
System has massive duplication across workflow, behaviors, shared-patterns, and commands. Logic is repeated in multiple places making maintenance difficult and creating confusion about source of truth.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Map all duplicate logic locations
- [ ] Create single source of truth for each concept
- [ ] Update imports to reference consolidated locations
- [ ] Remove redundant implementations
- [ ] Validate system still functions after consolidation

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each concept defined in exactly ONE location
- Clear import hierarchy established
- 70%+ reduction in repetitive content
- System functionality preserved
- Easier to understand and maintain

## Technical Notes
- Workflow should be THE execution guide
- Behaviors should focus on enforcement only
- Shared patterns should be truly shared utilities
- Commands should be simple triggers
