# [System-Engineer] Simplify commands to essential triggers only

**ID:** TASK-117-004
**Bug:** BUG-117
**Status:** PLANNED
**Assigned:** @System-Engineer
**Priority:** P1

## Description
Commands directory contains redundant implementations and complex logic. Commands should be simple triggers that invoke appropriate behaviors or workflow steps, not contain implementation details.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Audit all command files for implementation logic
- [ ] Identify truly essential command triggers
- [ ] Remove redundant command variations
- [ ] Simplify remaining commands to pure triggers
- [ ] Update command references throughout system

## Acceptance Criteria
- Commands reduced by 60%+
- Each command < 20 lines
- Commands only trigger, not implement
- No duplicate command functionality
- Clear command naming and purpose

## Technical Notes
- Commands should be like: /icc-start-work â†’ trigger workflow
- Not contain workflow logic themselves
- Reference behaviors/workflow for execution
- Focus on user-facing simplicity
