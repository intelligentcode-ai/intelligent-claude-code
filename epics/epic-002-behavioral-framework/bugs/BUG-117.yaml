title: System repetition and user interaction issues
description: Critical architectural issues - system has excessive repetitions across workflow/behaviors/patterns/commands, and workflow incorrectly shows user interaction happening inside subagents
priority: P0
severity: critical
owner: @PM
tasks:
  - TASK-117-001
  - TASK-117-002
  - TASK-117-003
  - TASK-117-004
reproduction_steps:
  - Review executable-workflow.md - shows user interaction in subagents
  - Compare behaviors vs shared-patterns - massive duplication
  - Check commands directory - redundant implementations
  - Analyze system complexity - too many overlapping concepts
acceptance_criteria:
  - User interaction only happens at parent level
  - No duplicate logic between behaviors and patterns
  - Commands simplified to essential triggers
  - System complexity reduced by 50%+
