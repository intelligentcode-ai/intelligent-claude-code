# Memory System Test Plan

## Test Suite for File-Based Memory System

### 1. Structure Tests
- [x] Verify .claude/memory/ directory exists
- [x] Check subdirectories: entities/, indexes/, relations/
- [x] Verify entity type folders exist (Knowledge/, learning/, pattern/, rolestate/)
- [x] Check year/month folder structure for temporal organization

### 2. MCP Reference Tests
- [x] Search for mcp__memory references in source code
- [x] Verify only documentation/bug reports contain MCP references
- [ ] Confirm no active code uses MCP memory functions

### 3. Memory Operation Tests
- [ ] Test StoreInMemory operation
- [ ] Test SearchMemory operation
- [ ] Test LoadFromMemory operation
- [ ] Test index updates after operations
- [ ] Test concurrent access handling

### 4. Learning Capture Tests
- [ ] Verify learning entities are created with proper format
- [ ] Check YAML frontmatter structure
- [ ] Test learning retrieval by ID
- [ ] Verify temporal directory organization

### 5. Performance Tests
- [ ] Measure store operation time
- [ ] Measure search operation time
- [ ] Test with 100+ memory entities
- [ ] Verify index performance benefits

### 6. Integration Tests
- [ ] Test memory operations during workflow execution
- [ ] Verify behavioral patterns use file-based memory
- [ ] Check task retrospectives create learnings
- [ ] Test memory persistence across sessions

## Test Results

### Structure Test Results
✅ Memory directory structure exists at .claude/memory/
✅ All required subdirectories present
✅ Proper year/month temporal organization
✅ Example learning entity found and properly formatted

### MCP Reference Test Results
✅ No MCP memory references in source code
✅ Only documentation and bug reports mention MCP
✅ No active implementation uses mcp__memory functions
