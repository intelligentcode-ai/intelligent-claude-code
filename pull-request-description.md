# Pull Request: Implement Dual Scoring System

## Summary
- Implements a dual scoring system tracking both Process compliance (P) and Quality output (Q) for all virtual team roles
- Adds automatic score display and updates during role operations
- Integrates scoring system with memory persistence and learning callouts

## Implementation Details

### Core Changes
1. **team-config.md**: Added scoring configuration section with point values, thresholds, and states
2. **virtual-team-core.md**: Updated all 13 role definitions to display scores in format `@Role (P: Xpts, Q: Ypts - State)`
3. **process-enforcement.md**: Added scoring enforcement architecture with automatic triggers
4. **virtual-team.md**: Added dual scoring system integration and learning callout system
5. **advanced-features.md**: Extended memory integration to capture score history and achievements

### Scoring System Features
- **Dual Metrics**: 
  - Professionalism (P): Process compliance, tool usage, delegation
  - Quality (Q): Implementation results, peer approval, test outcomes
- **Dynamic States**: Standard → Senior → Elite → Ultra/Master based on score thresholds
- **Learning Callouts**: Automatic insights generated for significant score changes
- **Team Member Replacement**: Automatic replacement at -10 P score threshold

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive PRD: `docs/requirements/dual-scoring-system-prd.md`
- Added feature documentation: `docs/features/dual-scoring-system.md`
- Created progress tracking: `progress/2025-07-07-scoring-implementation.md`
- Added test documentation: `tests/test_dual_scoring_system.md`

## Testing
The scoring system has been integrated into all existing role operations and will:
- Display scores at the start of each role activation
- Update scores after each operation completion
- Generate learning callouts for significant changes
- Persist score history in memory system
