## Problem Statement
Current system only creates specialists at <70% capability match. User wants ultra-experienced specialists for EVERY task, not just low matches.

### Current Issues:
- 70% threshold prevents specialist creation
- Generic roles used when specialist would be better
- Not all specialists are ultra-experienced
- Threshold logic is limiting

### Required Behavior:
- **ALWAYS** create ultra-experienced specialists
- **EVERY** task gets domain expert
- **10+ years** experience minimum
- **NO** threshold checking
- **ALWAYS** use sequential/ultra thinking

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **FR1**: Remove 70% threshold check completely
2. **FR2**: Create specialist for EVERY task type
3. **FR3**: All specialists have 10+ years experience
4. **FR4**: Specialist names reflect domain expertise
5. **FR5**: Reuse existing specialists when applicable
6. **FR6**: All specialists use sequential/ultra thinking

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **NFR1**: Ultra-experienced expertise level
2. **NFR2**: Clear specialist naming
3. **NFR3**: Specialist persistence
4. **NFR4**: Deep thinking on all tasks

## Sequential Thinking
sequential_thinking:
  required: true
  command: "/icc-think-sequential"
  focus_areas:
    - "Specialist creation logic"
    - "Experience level implementation"
    - "Thinking pattern integration"

## Implementation Details

### Affected Files
- `.claude/roles/specialists.md` - Remove threshold
- `.claude/behaviors/prb-creation-mandates.md` - Always specialist

### Key Changes Needed
```markdown
OLD Logic:
- Calculate match %
- If <70% → Create specialist
- If ≥70% → Use core role

NEW Logic:
- Identify domain need
- Create/reuse ultra-experienced specialist
- Apply sequential/ultra thinking
- Examples:
  - React work → @React-Expert (10+ years, ultra-thinking)
  - AWS work → @AWS-Solutions-Architect (10+ years, sequential)
  - Any domain → @[Domain]-Expert (10+ years, deep thinking)
```

## Success Criteria
1. No 70% threshold checks
2. Specialist for every domain
3. All with 10+ years experience
4. Appropriate specialist names
5. Sequential/ultra thinking applied

## Role Assignments
- **Lead**: @AI-Engineer (ultra-thinking)
- **Reviewer**: @Role-System-Architect (sequential thinking)

## Validation Steps
1. Test various domains → specialists created
2. Verify 10+ years on all
3. Check specialist reuse works
4. No threshold logic remains
5. Thinking patterns applied

## Notes
User preference: ALWAYS ultra-experienced specialists with deep thinking for quality and expertise.
