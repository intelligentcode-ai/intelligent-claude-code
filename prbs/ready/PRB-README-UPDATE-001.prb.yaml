prb_id: "PRB-README-UPDATE-001"
title: "[Developer] Update README.md with Major System Changes"
complexity: "Medium"
template_version: "medium-prb-template.yaml"
created_by: "@PM"
architect_review: "@Architect"
assigned_to: "@Developer"
estimated_effort: "1-2 hours"
priority: "High"

# Context Integration
project_context: |
  Intelligent Claude Code virtual team system with PRB-driven execution.
  Major system enhancements need to be reflected in main documentation.
  
  WORK LOCATION: This work is being conducted INSIDE the intelligent-claude-code project.

# User Request
original_request: |
  Update the README.md to reflect major system changes including:
  1. Memory-first pattern enforcement
  2. Story management system  
  3. Updated command count (12 commands, not 10)
  4. Git push in execution checklist
  5. PM + Architect collaboration for role assignments

# PRB Specification

## Problem Definition
Current README.md is outdated and missing key system features that have been implemented:
- Memory-first pattern enforcement is a core system feature but not documented
- Story management system with @PM + Architect collaboration is missing
- Command count is incorrect (shows 10, should be 12)
- Git push workflow not mentioned in execution practices
- Role assignment process needs PM + Architect collaboration details

## Technical Requirements

### Required Documentation Updates

1. **Memory-First Pattern Section** (NEW)
   - Add explanation of memory-first operations
   - Explain automatic pattern capture and reuse
   - Document learning bonus system
   - Location: After "Self-Learning System" section

2. **Story Management System** (NEW)
   - Document @PM break down story functionality
   - Explain @PM + Architect collaboration for story selection
   - Add story directory structure (stories/, stories/drafts/)
   - Location: New section after "How It Works"

3. **Command Count Correction**
   - Update "All 10 commands explained" to "All 12 commands explained"
   - Location: Line 97 in Documentation section

4. **Git Push Integration**
   - Add git push to execution workflow
   - Document automatic version bumping
   - Location: "How It Works" section

5. **PM + Architect Collaboration**
   - Update role assignment process
   - Explain joint analysis for complex work
   - Document story selection criteria
   - Location: Update existing role descriptions

### Content Requirements

#### Memory-First Pattern Content
```markdown
### ðŸ§  Memory-First Operations
- All operations check memory before action
- Automatic pattern capture and storage
- Learning bonus system (+0.5P/Q for applied patterns)
- Version-controlled in memory/ directory
- Topic-based organization with auto-pruning
```

#### Story Management Content
```markdown
## Story Management

Transform natural language stories into executable PRBs:

1. **Story Creation** â†’ Write stories in `stories/` directory
2. **@PM Analysis** â†’ "@PM break down authentication story"
3. **Architect Collaboration** â†’ Joint technical analysis
4. **PRB Generation** â†’ Ready-to-execute blueprints in `prbs/ready/`
5. **Story Selection** â†’ "@PM what story should we work on next?"

### Story Directory Structure
```
stories/
â”œâ”€â”€ user-authentication.md    # Business requirements
â”œâ”€â”€ payment-system.md         # Feature specifications  
â””â”€â”€ drafts/                   # Work-in-progress stories
    â””â”€â”€ api-redesign.md
```

### PM + Architect Process
- **Story Analysis**: @PM reads business goals, @Architect evaluates technical approach
- **Priority Setting**: Joint evaluation of business value + technical complexity
- **PRB Creation**: @PM generates appropriate complexity PRBs
- **Next Selection**: Consider dependencies, risk, current application state
```

#### Updated Command List
Update line 97: "All 12 commands explained"

#### Updated How It Works Section
```markdown
## How It Works

1. **Request Work** â†’ "Implement OAuth2 login"
2. **Memory Check** â†’ Search for existing patterns/learnings
3. **Analyze Complexity** â†’ System scores complexity (with PM + Architect for Large/Mega)
4. **Generate PRB** â†’ Self-contained blueprint with embedded context
5. **Specialist Executes** â†’ Single-pass implementation
6. **Git Integration** â†’ Auto version bump + commit + push
7. **Learn & Store** â†’ Capture new patterns in memory/
```

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
- [ ] Memory-first pattern section added with clear explanation
- [ ] Story management system documented with examples
- [ ] Command count corrected to 12
