    System claims PRBs complete when critical steps missing:
    - Says "COMPLETE" without reviews
    - Says "COMPLETE" without git operations
    - Says "COMPLETE" without knowledge capture
    - Ignores mandatory processual requirements

      current_issue: "May not exist or not enforce completion criteria"

    - path: "src/prb-templates/*.yaml"
      current_issue: "Completion criteria may be unclear"

## Problem Statement
System falsely claims PRB completion when mandatory steps are NOT done. This violates the fundamental PRB contract.

### Current Issues:
- Agent says "PRB COMPLETE" without executing all steps
- Templates may not clearly define completion criteria
- No enforcement of processual requirements
- System ignores mandatory sections

### Required Behavior:
- PRB is ONLY complete when ALL requirements met
- HARD block on claiming completion early
- Clear completion checklist enforcement
- System must track execution state

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **FR1**: Create mandatory completion checklist
2. **FR2**: Block "COMPLETE" claims without all steps
3. **FR3**: Track execution state throughout PRB
4. **FR4**: Enforce processual requirements
5. **FR5**: Add completion validation

### Processual Requirements
1. **PR1**: Must execute ALL git operations
2. **PR2**: Must complete ALL reviews
3. **PR3**: Must store ALL knowledge
4. **PR4**: Must validate ALL success criteria

## Git Operations
branch: "feature/PRB-017-fix-false-completion"
commits:
  - message: "fix: Add mandatory PRB completion checklist"
  - message: "fix: Block false completion claims"
git_privacy: true
version_bump: PATCH

## Knowledge Management
pre_execution:
  - action: "Search memory/prb-execution/"
  - query: "completion criteria validation"
post_execution:
  - action: "Store learnings"
  - path: "memory/prb-execution/completion-enforcement.md"

## Review Process
required_reviews:
  - reviewer: "@AI-PRB-Specialist"
    focus: "Completion criteria enforcement"
    must_pass: true

## Implementation Samples
completion_checklist: |
  ## PRB Completion Checklist
  [ ] All functional requirements met
  [ ] All processual requirements met
  [ ] Git operations executed
  [ ] Reviews completed and passed
  [ ] Knowledge captured
  [ ] Success criteria validated
  [ ] PRB moved to completed/
  
  ONLY when ALL checked â†’ PRB COMPLETE

## Success Criteria
1. No false completion claims
2. Clear execution tracking
3. Mandatory checklist enforcement
4. System respects all requirements

## Risk Assessment
- **CRITICAL Risk**: False completions break trust
- **Mitigation**: Hard enforcement of checklist
