### Example Violations Observed
- git_privacy: true → Agent still adds AI co-author
- Reviews required → No review executed
- Knowledge capture → No memory storage
- Git operations → Not performed or done wrong

## Problem Statement
PRB settings and requirements are being completely ignored during execution:
- git_privacy setting ignored (AI mentions in commits)
- Required reviews skipped
- Knowledge capture not performed
- Git operations missing or incorrect
- Validation steps not executed

### Current Issues:
- Settings present but not enforced
- Requirements listed but not followed
- Git operations section ignored
- Learning capture skipped
- Reviews not executed

### Required Behavior:
- **MANDATORY** execution of ALL PRB sections
- **ENFORCE** every setting specified
- **EXECUTE** all git operations as defined
- **COMPLETE** reviews and knowledge capture
- **VALIDATE** all requirements met

# MANDATORY: Requirements Section
requirements:
  functional:
    - "PRB execution must follow EVERY section without exceptions"
    - "Enforce ALL settings specified in PRB exactly as written"
    - "Execute git operations EXACTLY as specified in git_operations section"
    - "Complete ALL reviews by assigned reviewers before proceeding"
    - "Capture knowledge as mandated in knowledge_management section"
    - "Validate ALL requirements met in requirements section"
  
  processual:
    - "Respect git_privacy=true for commit messages (NO AI mentions)"
    - "Follow branch_protection=true strategy from config"
    - "Use default_branch=main for all git operations"
    - "Apply autonomy_level=L3 for autonomous compliance checking"
    - "100% PRB compliance - no skipped sections ever"
    - "Settings enforcement verification at each step"
    - "Complete execution tracking and documentation"
  
  technical:
    - "MARKDOWN-BASED system only - no code/functions/classes"
    - "Section-by-section execution compliance"
    - "Git operation exact specification following"
    - "Review and validation step enforcement"

## Sequential Thinking
sequential_thinking:
  required: true
  command: "/icc-think-sequential"
  focus_areas:
    - "PRB section enforcement"
    - "Settings compliance"
    - "Git operation execution"
    - "Review completion"

## Implementation Details

### Affected Files
- `.claude/behaviors/prb-execution.md` - Create if needed
- `.claude/behaviors/prb-enforcement.md` - Add execution checks
- ALL PRB templates - Add enforcement reminders

### Key Changes Needed

1. **PRB Execution Checklist**:
```markdown
MANDATORY EXECUTION CHECKLIST:
[ ] Configuration section - ALL settings applied
[ ] Git operations - EVERY command executed
[ ] Reviews - ALL reviewers complete
[ ] Knowledge capture - Stored in specified path
[ ] Validation - ALL steps executed
[ ] Risk mitigation - Applied as specified

CRITICAL: Skip NOTHING. Execute EVERYTHING.
```

2. **Setting Enforcement**:
```markdown
git_privacy: true means:
- NO "Generated with Claude Code"
- NO "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
- NO AI mentions anywhere
- Clean professional commits only
```

3. **Execution Tracking**:
```markdown
For EACH PRB section:
1. Read requirement
2. Execute exactly as specified
3. Verify completion
4. Document in execution log
```

## Success Criteria
1. 100% PRB section execution
2. All settings properly enforced
3. Git operations match PRB exactly
4. Reviews completed by specified roles
5. Knowledge stored as mandated

## Role Assignments
- **Lead**: @AI-Engineer (ultra-thinking)
- **Reviewer**: @AI-Compliance-Specialist

## Git Operations (MUST EXECUTE)
- Branch: feature/fix-prb-settings-enforcement
- Commits: 
  - "Fix PRB execution checklist enforcement"
  - "Add setting compliance verification"
- NO AI mentions (git_privacy: true)

## Knowledge Capture (MUST EXECUTE)
- Store in: memory/Pattern/2025/08/prb-execution-compliance.md
- Topics: PRB enforcement, settings compliance

## Validation Steps
1. Test PRB execution follows all sections
2. Verify git_privacy properly enforced
3. Check reviews actually executed
4. Confirm knowledge capture completed

    CRITICAL: Skip NOTHING. Execute EVERYTHING.
  
  settings_enforcement: |
    git_privacy: true means:
    - NO "Generated with Claude Code" in commits
    - NO "Co-Authored-By: Claude" in commits  
    - NO AI mentions anywhere in git operations
    - Clean professional commits only

    - Review Process: "@AI-Compliance-Specialist completed review"
    - Knowledge Management: "Stored in memory/Pattern/2025/08/..."

## Notes
CRITICAL: Every PRB section is MANDATORY. No exceptions. Execute EVERYTHING specified in the PRB.
