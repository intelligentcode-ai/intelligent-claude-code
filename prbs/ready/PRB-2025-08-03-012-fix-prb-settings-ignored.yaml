# Product Requirement Blueprint (PRB)

## Metadata
title: "[AI-Engineer] Fix PRB settings and requirements being ignored during implementation"
prb_id: "PRB-2025-08-03-012"
complexity: "Large"
score: 19
priority: "CRITICAL"
created_by: "@PM"
created_at: "2025-08-03"
tags: ["prb-execution", "settings-enforcement", "critical-bug"]

## Context
type: "BUG_FIX"
priority: "CRITICAL"
project: "intelligent-claude-code"
requester: "User - PRB settings completely ignored during execution"
git_privacy: true

## Complete System Context
system_type: "MARKDOWN-BASED AI-AGENTIC VIRTUAL TEAM SYSTEM"
critical_setting: "git_privacy: true - NO AI MENTIONS IN COMMITS"

### Example Violations Observed
- git_privacy: true → Agent still adds AI co-author
- Reviews required → No review executed
- Knowledge capture → No memory storage
- Git operations → Not performed or done wrong

## Problem Statement
PRB settings and requirements are being completely ignored during execution:
- git_privacy setting ignored (AI mentions in commits)
- Required reviews skipped
- Knowledge capture not performed
- Git operations missing or incorrect
- Validation steps not executed

### Current Issues:
- Settings present but not enforced
- Requirements listed but not followed
- Git operations section ignored
- Learning capture skipped
- Reviews not executed

### Required Behavior:
- **MANDATORY** execution of ALL PRB sections
- **ENFORCE** every setting specified
- **EXECUTE** all git operations as defined
- **COMPLETE** reviews and knowledge capture
- **VALIDATE** all requirements met

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **FR1**: PRB execution must follow EVERY section
2. **FR2**: Enforce ALL settings without exception
3. **FR3**: Execute git operations EXACTLY as specified
4. **FR4**: Complete ALL reviews before proceeding
5. **FR5**: Capture knowledge as mandated

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **NFR1**: 100% PRB compliance
2. **NFR2**: No skipped sections
3. **NFR3**: Settings enforcement verification

## Sequential Thinking
sequential_thinking:
  required: true
  command: "/icc-think-sequential"
  focus_areas:
    - "PRB section enforcement"
    - "Settings compliance"
    - "Git operation execution"
    - "Review completion"

## Implementation Details

### Affected Files
- `.claude/behaviors/prb-execution.md` - Create if needed
- `.claude/behaviors/prb-enforcement.md` - Add execution checks
- ALL PRB templates - Add enforcement reminders

### Key Changes Needed

1. **PRB Execution Checklist**:
```markdown
MANDATORY EXECUTION CHECKLIST:
[ ] Configuration section - ALL settings applied
[ ] Git operations - EVERY command executed
[ ] Reviews - ALL reviewers complete
[ ] Knowledge capture - Stored in specified path
[ ] Validation - ALL steps executed
[ ] Risk mitigation - Applied as specified

CRITICAL: Skip NOTHING. Execute EVERYTHING.
```

2. **Setting Enforcement**:
```markdown
git_privacy: true means:
- NO "Generated with Claude Code"
- NO "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
- NO AI mentions anywhere
- Clean professional commits only
```

3. **Execution Tracking**:
```markdown
For EACH PRB section:
1. Read requirement
2. Execute exactly as specified
3. Verify completion
4. Document in execution log
```

## Success Criteria
1. 100% PRB section execution
2. All settings properly enforced
3. Git operations match PRB exactly
4. Reviews completed by specified roles
5. Knowledge stored as mandated

## Role Assignments
- **Lead**: @AI-Engineer (ultra-thinking)
- **Reviewer**: @AI-Compliance-Specialist

## Git Operations (MUST EXECUTE)
- Branch: feature/fix-prb-settings-enforcement
- Commits: 
  - "Fix PRB execution checklist enforcement"
  - "Add setting compliance verification"
- NO AI mentions (git_privacy: true)

## Knowledge Capture (MUST EXECUTE)
- Store in: memory/Pattern/2025/08/prb-execution-compliance.md
- Topics: PRB enforcement, settings compliance

## Validation Steps
1. Test PRB execution follows all sections
2. Verify git_privacy properly enforced
3. Check reviews actually executed
4. Confirm knowledge capture completed

## Notes
CRITICAL: Every PRB section is MANDATORY. No exceptions. Execute EVERYTHING specified in the PRB.
