# Product Requirement Blueprint (PRB)

## Metadata
title: "[AI-Engineer] Fix PRB scope creep - comments should extend current PRB not create new ones"
prb_id: "PRB-2025-08-03-015"
complexity: "Large"
score: 16
priority: "HIGH"
created_by: "@PM"
created_at: "2025-08-03"
tags: ["prb-execution", "scope-management", "behavioral-fix"]

## Context
type: "BUG_FIX"
priority: "HIGH"
project: "intelligent-claude-code"
requester: "User - System creates new PRBs instead of extending current one"
git_privacy: true

## Complete System Context
system_type: "MARKDOWN-BASED AI-AGENTIC VIRTUAL TEAM SYSTEM"
project_root: "/Users/ksamaschke/Work/Engineering/intelligent-claude-code"

### Current Behavior (WRONG)
- User comment during PRB execution → New PRB created
- Every observation → New PRB
- Scope constantly expanding with new PRBs

### Required Behavior
- Comments during PRB execution → Extend current PRB scope
- Only create new PRB if explicitly unrelated
- Medium+ PRBs can absorb related requirements
- Maintain PRB focus while adapting to feedback

## Problem Statement
During PRB execution, user comments/observations are triggering new PRB creation instead of being incorporated into the current PRB's scope. This causes:
- PRB proliferation
- Loss of context
- Fragmented execution
- Incomplete original PRBs

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **FR1**: Detect when executing within PRB context
2. **FR2**: Incorporate feedback into current PRB scope
3. **FR3**: Only create new PRB for unrelated issues
4. **FR4**: Update PRB scope tracking in memory
5. **FR5**: Medium+ PRBs can expand scope

### Processual Requirements
1. **PR1**: Track current PRB execution state
2. **PR2**: Log scope extensions to memory
3. **PR3**: Review expanded scope with SME
4. **PR4**: Update PRB documentation

## Implementation Details

### Affected Files
- `.claude/behaviors/prb-enforcement.md` - Add execution context
- `.claude/behaviors/prb-auto-trigger.md` - Check current PRB
- `.claude/behaviors/shared-patterns/prb-execution.md` - Create

### Key Changes Needed
```markdown
# PRB Execution Context Pattern
When executing PRB:
1. Set CURRENT_PRB context
2. User comments → Check relevance
3. If related → Extend current PRB
4. If unrelated → Queue for later
5. Only create new PRB if:
   - Explicitly different domain
   - Critical and unrelated
   - Current PRB complete

# Scope Extension Rules
- Tiny PRBs: No scope extension
- Medium PRBs: Can absorb related tasks
- Large PRBs: Can absorb sub-domains
- Mega PRBs: Can absorb most feedback
```

## Success Criteria
1. Comments extend current PRB
2. No unnecessary PRB creation
3. PRB scope tracked properly
4. Context maintained

## Role Assignments
- **Lead**: @AI-Engineer (ultra-thinking)
- **Reviewer**: @PRB-Execution-Specialist

## Git Operations
- Branch: feature/fix-prb-scope-creep
- Commits: 
  - "fix: Add PRB execution context tracking"
  - "fix: Implement scope extension rules"
- version_bump: PATCH

## Knowledge Management
- Pre: Search memory/execution/ for patterns
- Post: Store in memory/execution/prb-scope-management.md

## Documentation Updates
- Update PRB execution guide
- Add scope management section

## Review Process
- Reviewer: @PRB-Execution-Specialist
- Focus: Scope extension logic
- Gate: After implementation

## Notes
Critical: Comments during PRB execution should EXTEND scope, not create new PRBs. Only truly unrelated issues warrant new PRBs.
