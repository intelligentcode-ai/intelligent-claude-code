## Metadata
title: "[AI-Engineer] Fix PRB enforcement being bypassed with direct execution"
prb_id: "PRB-2025-08-03-002"
complexity: "Large"
score: 18
created_by: "@PM"
created_at: "2025-08-03"
tags: ["prb-enforcement", "critical-fix", "behavioral-patterns"]

## Context
type: "BUG_FIX"
priority: "HIGH"
project: "intelligent-claude-code"
requester: "User - System attempted 'I'll...' instead of PRB"
git_privacy: true

## Problem Statement
PRB enforcement is being bypassed:
- System said "I'll immediately update..." instead of generating PRB
- Work detection patterns not catching all cases
- @Role mentions not triggering PRB generation
- Direct execution attempts not blocked

### Current Issues:
- Enforcement patterns too weak
- "I'll" responses not blocked
- Bug reports not detected as work
- PRB generation not automatic

### Required Behavior:
- **100% Work Detection**: ALL work must trigger PRB
- **Zero Bypass**: No "I'll" or direct execution
- **Auto PRB**: Immediate PRB generation for work
- **Hard Block**: Stop execution without PRB

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **FR1**: Block ALL "I'll/I will/Let me" responses
2. **FR2**: Detect bug reports as work requiring PRB
3. **FR3**: @Role mentions MUST generate PRB
4. **FR4**: Auto-generate PRB for any work intent
5. **FR5**: Hard stop on bypass attempts

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **NFR1**: Zero tolerance enforcement
2. **NFR2**: Clear blocking messages
3. **NFR3**: Automatic PRB generation

## Implementation Details

### Affected Files
- `.claude/behaviors/prb-enforcement.md` - Strengthen patterns
- `.claude/behaviors/prb-auto-trigger.md` - Add detection
- `.claude/behaviors/shared-patterns/enforcement-patterns.md` - Create

### Key Changes Needed
```markdown
BLOCK Patterns:
- "I'll*" → STOP + Generate PRB
- "I will*" → STOP + Generate PRB  
- "Let me*" → STOP + Generate PRB
- Direct tool use for work → STOP + Generate PRB

DETECT as Work:
- "Fix*" → Work
- "Update*" → Work
- "The system is*" → Bug report → Work
- "Observations:*" → Issue report → Work
```

## Success Criteria
1. Zero "I'll" responses get through
2. All bug reports generate PRBs
3. 100% work detection rate
4. No direct execution

## Role Assignments
- **Lead**: @AI-Engineer
- **Reviewer**: @AI-Enforcement-Specialist

## Validation Steps
1. Test "I'll fix" → Blocked + PRB
2. Test bug report → PRB generated
3. Test @Role mention → PRB created
4. Verify hard stops work

## Notes
CRITICAL: Zero tolerance for PRB bypass. Every work attempt must generate PRB.
