## Problem Statement
PRB enforcement is being bypassed:
- System said "I'll immediately update..." instead of generating PRB
- Work detection patterns not catching all cases
- @Role mentions not triggering PRB generation
- Direct execution attempts not blocked

### Current Issues:
- Enforcement patterns too weak
- "I'll" responses not blocked
- Bug reports not detected as work
- PRB generation not automatic

### Required Behavior:
- **100% Work Detection**: ALL work must trigger PRB
- **Zero Bypass**: No "I'll" or direct execution
- **Auto PRB**: Immediate PRB generation for work
- **Hard Block**: Stop execution without PRB

# MANDATORY: Requirements Section
requirements:
  functional:
    - "Block ALL 'I'll/I will/Let me' responses before execution"
    - "Detect bug reports as work requiring PRB generation"
    - "@Role mentions MUST automatically generate PRB"
    - "Auto-generate PRB for any work intent detection"
    - "Hard stop on all PRB bypass attempts"
    - "100% work detection rate with zero false negatives"
  
  processual:
    - "Respect git_privacy=true for commit messages (strip AI mentions)"
    - "Follow branch_protection=true strategy from config"
    - "Use default_branch=main for all git operations"
    - "Apply autonomy_level=L3 for autonomous enforcement"
    - "Zero tolerance enforcement with clear blocking messages"
    - "Automatic PRB generation without user intervention"
  
  technical:
    - "MARKDOWN-BASED system only - no code/functions/classes"
    - "Pattern-based detection in behavioral markdown files"
    - "Real-time interception of execution attempts"
    - "Multi-layer detection (input scanner, pattern matcher, PRB checker)"

## Implementation Details

### Affected Files
- `.claude/behaviors/prb-enforcement.md` - Strengthen patterns
- `.claude/behaviors/prb-auto-trigger.md` - Add detection
- `.claude/behaviors/shared-patterns/enforcement-patterns.md` - Create

### Key Changes Needed
```markdown
BLOCK Patterns:
- "I'll*" → STOP + Generate PRB
- "I will*" → STOP + Generate PRB  
- "Let me*" → STOP + Generate PRB
- Direct tool use for work → STOP + Generate PRB

DETECT as Work:
- "Fix*" → Work
- "Update*" → Work
- "The system is*" → Bug report → Work
- "Observations:*" → Issue report → Work
```

## Success Criteria
1. Zero "I'll" responses get through
2. All bug reports generate PRBs
3. 100% work detection rate
4. No direct execution

## Role Assignments
- **Lead**: @AI-Engineer
- **Reviewer**: @AI-Enforcement-Specialist

## Validation Steps
1. Test "I'll fix" → Blocked + PRB
2. Test bug report → PRB generated
3. Test @Role mention → PRB created
4. Verify hard stops work

  example_scope: |
    Files: src/behaviors/prb-enforcement.md, src/behaviors/prb-auto-trigger.md, src/behaviors/shared-patterns/enforcement-patterns.md
    - Add BLOCK patterns for 'I'll*', 'I will*', 'Let me*'
    - Enhance work detection for bug reports and @Role mentions
    - Create enforcement-patterns.md with hard stop mechanisms
    - Implement multi-layer detection system

    - Direct tool use for work → STOP + Generate PRB

    - "The system is*" → Bug report → Generate PRB
    - "Observations:*" → Issue report → Generate PRB
    
  validation_tests: |
    1. Input: "I'll fix the auth system" → Expected: BLOCKED + PRB generated
    2. Input: "The system is bypassing PRBs" → Expected: PRB generated for bug fix
    3. Input: "@Developer implement login" → Expected: PRB generated immediately
    4. Input: Direct tool execution → Expected: HARD STOP + PRB required

## Notes
CRITICAL: Zero tolerance for PRB bypass. Every work attempt must generate PRB.
