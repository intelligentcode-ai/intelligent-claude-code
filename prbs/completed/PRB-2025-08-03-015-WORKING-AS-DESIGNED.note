# PRB-015 Closure Note

**Status:** CLOSED - Working as Designed
**Assessed by:** @Architect
**Date:** 2025-08-04

## Architectural Assessment
This PRB misunderstands the intended system behavior:
- PRBs are designed to be self-contained execution units
- Creating new PRBs for new requirements is the CORRECT behavior
- Scope creep prevention through PRB boundaries is a FEATURE

## Design Rationale
- PRBs should maintain focus and avoid scope bloat
- New requirements trigger new PRBs with proper dependencies
- This maintains traceability and prevents execution complexity

## Conclusion
The current behavior is architecturally correct. The system properly prevents scope creep by creating focused, manageable PRBs.
