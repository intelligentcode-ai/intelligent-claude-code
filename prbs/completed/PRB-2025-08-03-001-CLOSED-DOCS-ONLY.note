# PRB-001 Closure Note

**Status:** CLOSED - Documentation Enhancement Only
**Assessed by:** @Architect
**Date:** 2025-08-04

## Technical Assessment
The behavioral patterns already properly implement project-only execution scope:
- Template loading hierarchy: project → .claude → ~/.claude ✓
- Configuration loading separates user global from project ✓
- Installation vs execution paths properly distinguished ✓

## Evidence
- `config-loader.md` correctly specifies paths
- `template-loading.md` uses proper hierarchy
- `directory-structure.md` respects project boundaries

## Recommendation
No code changes needed. Documentation could be enhanced for clarity, but core functionality is correct.
