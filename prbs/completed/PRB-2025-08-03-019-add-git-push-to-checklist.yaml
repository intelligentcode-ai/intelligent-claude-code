      issue: "Git Operations Validation missing git push step"
      line: 120-128

## Problem Statement
Git push is NOT included in the mandatory execution checklist, causing branches to be created locally but never pushed to remote.

### Current Issue:
```markdown
## Git Operations ✓
[ ] All changes staged properly
[ ] Commit messages follow privacy requirements
[ ] Branch operations completed
[ ] No uncommitted work remains
[ ] Git status clean
```
Missing: `[ ] Changes pushed to remote repository`

## Requirements
functional:
  - "Add git push as mandatory checklist item"
  - "Ensure push happens AFTER all commits"
  - "Verify push success before marking complete"

processual:
  - "git push must be explicit requirement"
  - "Cannot claim PRB complete without push"

    [ ] Commit messages follow privacy requirements
    [ ] Branch operations completed
    [ ] Changes pushed to remote repository
    [ ] No uncommitted work remains
    [ ] Git status clean

## Success Criteria
1. Git push explicitly in checklist
2. Push happens after commits
3. Cannot complete without push
