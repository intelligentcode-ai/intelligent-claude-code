# Already Implemented PRB Note

PRB-2025-08-03-005 "Fix specialist threshold" appears to already be properly implemented throughout the system.

Evidence found:
- specialists.md: "<70% match: Create specialist"
- role-management.md: "Threshold: >70% match required"
- story-breakdown.md: "specialist expertise needed (>70% capability match)"
- prb-creation-mandates.md: "capability match justification (>70%)"

The 70% threshold for specialist creation vs using existing roles is already enforced across all relevant behaviors and documentation.
