# PRB-003 Investigation Note

## Investigation Summary
PRB-2025-08-03-003 claims the system is using MCP memory tools instead of file-based storage, but investigation reveals:

### Findings:
1. **memory-operations.md** - Already correctly specifies file-based storage
   - Uses memory/ directory structure
   - Markdown files with dated entries
   - No MCP references found

2. **Template System** - Already correctly implemented
   - Templates exist in src/prb-templates/
   - Template loading hierarchy properly defined
   - Complexity-based selection documented

3. **No MCP References** - grep search found zero MCP memory calls in:
   - src/behaviors/
   - src/commands/
   - Any project source files

### Conclusion:
This appears to be a misunderstanding. The system is already designed and documented for file-based memory storage. The issue may be:
- User misinterpreting system behavior
- Confusion between design and runtime behavior
- Issue exists outside project scope (in ~/.claude)

### Recommendation:
This PRB should be closed as "Not Applicable" - the system is already correctly designed for file-based memory.
