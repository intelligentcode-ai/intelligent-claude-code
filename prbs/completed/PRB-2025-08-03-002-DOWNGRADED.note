# PRB-002 Downgrade Note

**Status:** DOWNGRADED - Minor Enhancement
**Assessed by:** @Architect
**Date:** 2025-08-04

## Technical Assessment
PRB enforcement is already comprehensive:
- Multi-layer detection implemented
- Advanced pattern matching active
- Real-time interception documented
- Auto-correction patterns comprehensive

## Finding
The core enforcement is architecturally sound. If specific "I'll" pattern bypasses exist, they're edge cases, not fundamental flaws.

## Recommendation
Could add specific "I'll/I will/Let me" pattern detection as a minor enhancement, but the critical enforcement infrastructure is already solid.
