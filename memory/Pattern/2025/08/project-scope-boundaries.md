# Pattern: Project Scope Boundaries for AI-Agentic Systems

## Problem
AI-agentic markdown-based systems need clear separation between installation scope (global system files) and execution scope (project-confined operations) to prevent unauthorized system modifications and maintain project boundaries.

## Solution
Implement dual-scope architecture with clear boundary enforcement:

### Installation Scope (~/claude/)
- **Purpose**: Global system access for templates, configurations, role definitions
- **Access**: Read-only during execution
- **Contents**: User config, role definitions, system templates
- **Modification**: Only during installation/update processes

### Execution Scope (./ and .claude/)
- **Purpose**: Project-confined operations and data storage
- **Access**: Full read/write during execution
- **Contents**: Project config, memory entities, generated artifacts
- **Boundary**: Never write to ~/.claude/ during execution

## Implementation Patterns

### Configuration Hierarchy
```markdown
1. Embedded config (in assignment files)
2. Project config (.claude/config.md - within project scope)
3. User global (~/.claude/config.md - read-only during execution)
4. System defaults
```

### Memory Operations
```markdown
**Base Directory:** .claude/memory/ (within project root - PROJECT SCOPE ONLY)
**Boundary Enforcement:** Never write to ~/.claude/ during execution
```

### Command Behavior
```markdown
**Project Directories**: Ensure .claude/, prbs/, stories/ exist in PROJECT ROOT
**Error Handling**: PROJECT_BOUNDARY_VIOLATION for ~/.claude/ write attempts
```

### Validation Patterns
```markdown
**Scope Validation**: Verify no unauthorized modifications to ~/.claude/
**Error Messages**: Clear boundary violation reporting
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Clear Distinction Required**: AI-agentic systems must distinguish installation vs execution contexts
2. **Boundary Enforcement**: Active validation prevents accidental system modifications
3. **User Experience**: Clear error messages help users understand scope boundaries
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Changes maintain existing installation functionality

## Prevention Steps

1. **Documentation**: Clearly document scope boundaries in all behavioral patterns
2. **Validation**: Implement active boundary checking in validation patterns
3. **Error Handling**: Provide specific error messages for boundary violations
4. **Context Loading**: Distinguish between read (config) and write (execution) operations
