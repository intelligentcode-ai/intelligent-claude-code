# Git Push Requirements in PRB Execution

## 2025-08-03: Git Push Made Mandatory in PRB Execution Checklist
**Context:** PRB-2025-08-03-019
**Problem:** Git push was missing from PRB execution checklist, allowing PRBs to complete without pushing changes to remote repository
**Solution:** Added "[ ] Changes pushed to remote repository" to Git Operations validation checklist
**Location:** src/behaviors/prb-execution.md, lines 127

### Implementation Details
- Added push requirement after "Branch operations completed" but before "No uncommitted work remains"
- Maintains logical sequence: stage → commit → push → verify clean state
- Ensures team collaboration by requiring remote sync before PRB completion
- Prevents local-only PRB completions

### Key Learnings
1. **Checklist Completeness**: PRB execution checklists must be comprehensive to prevent incomplete work
2. **Git Operations Sequence**: Push must come after commits but before final validation
3. **Team Collaboration**: Mandatory push ensures work is available to team members
4. **PRB Enforcement**: Missing push requirement was gap in PRB completion validation

### Prevention Strategies
- Review all PRB execution checklists for completeness
- Ensure git operations follow proper sequence
- Validate that team collaboration requirements are explicit
- Test PRB execution to identify missing steps

### Code Examples
**Before:**
```markdown
## Git Operations ✓
[ ] All changes staged properly
[ ] Commit messages follow privacy requirements
[ ] Branch operations completed
[ ] No uncommitted work remains
[ ] Git status clean
```

**After:**
```markdown
## Git Operations ✓
[ ] All changes staged properly
[ ] Commit messages follow privacy requirements
[ ] Branch operations completed
[ ] Changes pushed to remote repository
[ ] No uncommitted work remains
[ ] Git status clean
```
