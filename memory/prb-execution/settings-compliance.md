# PRB Execution Settings Compliance

## 2025-08-03: PRB Settings and Requirements Enforcement Fix
**Context:** PRB-2025-08-03-012 - Fix PRB settings being ignored during implementation
**Problem:** PRB settings and requirements completely ignored during execution
**Solution:** Mandatory execution checklist with settings compliance verification

### Critical Issues Addressed
1. **Settings Enforcement**: git_privacy setting ignored (AI mentions in commits)
2. **Section Skipping**: Required PRB sections not executed
3. **No Compliance Checking**: Settings applied but not verified
4. **Template Gaps**: Templates lacked enforcement reminders

### Implementation Details

#### 1. PRB Execution Checklist (src/behaviors/prb-execution.md)
```markdown
MANDATORY PRB SECTION EXECUTION:
☐ 1. Complete Context Section - ALL file references validated, settings loaded
☐ 2. Requirements Section - EVERY functional/processual/technical requirement met
☐ 3. Git Operations Section - EVERY command executed exactly as specified
☐ 4. Knowledge Management Section - ALL learnings captured in specified paths
☐ 5. Review Process Section - ALL reviewers complete their reviews
☐ 6. Implementation Samples Section - Applied correctly with examples

CRITICAL SETTINGS ENFORCEMENT:
☐ git_privacy: true → NO "Generated with Claude Code", NO "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
☐ branch_protection: true → Follow branch protection rules exactly
☐ autonomy_level → Apply L1/L2/L3 behaviors as configured
☐ memory_integration: true → Store ALL learnings as specified
```

#### 2. Settings Compliance Verification (src/behaviors/prb-enforcement.md)
```markdown
MANDATORY SETTINGS COMPLIANCE:
☐ git_privacy: true → Strip ALL AI mentions from commits
☐ branch_protection: true → Follow protection strategy exactly
☐ default_branch setting → Use for all git operations
☐ autonomy_level → Apply appropriate behavior patterns
☐ memory_integration: true → Store learnings in memory/
☐ All CLAUDE.md settings → Applied throughout execution
```

#### 3. Template Updates (All 5 PRB Templates)
- Added execution checklists to all templates
- Git privacy warnings in git_operations sections
- Enforcement reminders at template headers
- Section-by-section completion tracking

### Enforcement Mechanisms

#### Git Privacy Enforcement
**git_privacy: true MEANS:**
- NO "Generated with Claude Code" in any commit
- NO "Co-Authored-By: Claude" in any commit
- NO AI mentions anywhere in git operations
- Clean professional commits only
- Strip all AI references before git commands

#### Section Completion Tracking
- Each PRB section must be explicitly completed
- No skipping allowed, even for "trivial" work
- Evidence required for each completion
- State validation before progression

#### Settings Compliance Validation
- All settings loaded from configuration
- Settings applied throughout execution
- Compliance verified at each step
- Violations block further execution

### Learning Patterns Captured

#### PRB Execution Compliance
1. **Mandatory Checklists**: Every PRB has 6 sections, all must be completed
2. **Settings Inheritance**: All sub-PRBs inherit parent settings
3. **Privacy Filters**: git_privacy affects ALL git operations
4. **No Shortcuts**: Cannot skip sections even for simple work

#### Template Enforcement
1. **Visual Warnings**: ⚠️ symbols for critical requirements
2. **Execution Checklists**: Embedded in implementation_samples
3. **Settings Reminders**: In git_operations sections
4. **Cascading Requirements**: Sub-PRBs inherit all enforcement

#### Compliance Verification
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: All execution attempts monitored
2. **Auto-correction**: Violations trigger immediate correction
3. **State Validation**: Each transition requires evidence
4. **Blocking Mechanisms**: Non-compliance prevents progression

### Files Modified
- src/behaviors/prb-execution.md: Added mandatory execution checklist
- src/behaviors/prb-enforcement.md: Added settings compliance verification
- src/prb-templates/nano-prb-template.yaml: Added enforcement reminders
- src/prb-templates/tiny-prb-template.yaml: Added enforcement reminders
- src/prb-templates/medium-prb-template.yaml: Added enforcement reminders
- src/prb-templates/large-prb-template.yaml: Added enforcement reminders
- src/prb-templates/mega-prb-template.yaml: Added enforcement reminders

### Success Metrics
1. 100% PRB section execution compliance
2. git_privacy setting properly enforced
3. No AI mentions in git operations
4. All settings applied as specified
5. Knowledge captured in memory/

### Prevention Strategy
1. **Template Level**: Warnings and checklists in all templates
2. **Behavior Level**: Enforcement patterns in execution behaviors
3. **Monitoring Level**: Real-time compliance verification
4. **Validation Level**: State-based progression gates
