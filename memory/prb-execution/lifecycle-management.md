# PRB Lifecycle Management Learnings

## 2025-08-03: PRB File Movement Protocol Enhancement
**Context:** PRB-2025-08-03-016
**Problem:** PRBs were remaining in prbs/ready/ after execution completion, causing lifecycle management issues
**Solution:** Enhanced PRB execution behavior with mandatory file movement as absolute final step

### Key Improvements
1. **Added PENDING_LIFECYCLE State**: Clear transition point between git operations and PRB cleanup
2. **Enforced Sequential Validation**: PRB move only occurs after ALL other validations pass
3. **Mandatory Final Step**: PRB file movement is now the absolute final operation
4. **State Management Rules**: Clear protocol for PRB state transitions and validation

### Implementation Pattern
```markdown
MANDATORY SEQUENCE:
1. Complete all functional requirements
2. Complete all processual requirements  
3. Complete all git operations and push
4. Complete review process
5. Complete knowledge capture
6. Validate success criteria
7. FINAL STEP: Move PRB file from prbs/ready/ to prbs/completed/
```

### Prevention Mechanisms
- PRBs remain in ready/ throughout entire execution
- Failed executions leave PRB in ready/ for retry
- No premature file moves that could lose work
- Clear state validation at each transition

### Quality Gate Enhancement
Updated enforcement logic to ensure PRB movement only occurs after all prior validations pass, preventing state inconsistencies and lost PRBs.

**Learning Application**: Apply this sequential validation pattern to other lifecycle operations to prevent similar state management issues.

## 2024-12-15: Original PRB Execution Framework
**Context:** Initial PRB system design
**Problem:** Need systematic approach to PRB execution with validation
**Solution:** Created comprehensive execution behavior with mandatory checklist validation

### Core Principles
- All PRBs must complete mandatory checklist sections
- State transitions require validation guards
- False completion detection and prevention
- Quality gates for each execution phase

### Checklist Categories
1. Functional Requirements Validation
2. Processual Requirements Validation  
3. Review Validation
4. Success Criteria Validation
5. Knowledge Capture Validation
6. Git Operations Validation
7. PRB Lifecycle Validation

**Learning Application**: This systematic approach ensures nothing is missed during PRB execution and provides clear completion criteria.
