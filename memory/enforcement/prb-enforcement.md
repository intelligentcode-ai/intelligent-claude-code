# PRB Enforcement Mechanisms

## 2025-08-04: Direct Execution Blocking Enforcement System
**Context:** PRB-001-mandatory-subagent-execution
**Problem:** System failed to prevent direct parent execution, allowing bypass of PRB subagent requirements
**Solution:** Comprehensive enforcement system with real-time violation detection and auto-correction

### Direct Execution Blocking Techniques
**Real-Time Monitoring Patterns:**
- File operation attempts by parent
- Git command execution by parent
- Code implementation by parent
- System configuration changes by parent
- Any work execution bypassing subagent system

**Immediate Block Actions:**
1. STOP execution attempt immediately
2. Analyze work complexity and generate appropriate PRB
3. Force Task tool subagent creation
4. Transfer blocked work to subagent
5. Log violation for learning and pattern improvement

### Auto-Correction Patterns
**Missing PRB Correction:**
- STOP execution → Complexity analysis → PRB generation → Subagent creation → Execute via subagent

**Wrong Template Correction:**
- STOP execution → Re-analyze complexity → Load correct template → Update subagent requirements → Resume via subagent

**Direct Execution Attempt Correction:**
- IMMEDIATE BLOCK → PRB generation → Context gathering → Subagent creation → Execution transfer → Coordinator mode

### Violation Detection Methods
**@Role Mention Detection:**
- All formats: "@Role:", "@Role", "Ask @Role", "[@Role]", "@Role-Name"
- Natural language: "Can you ask @Security-Engineer to review?"
- Multiple roles: "@PM and @Developer should coordinate"
- Action: Generate PRB → Create subagent → Execute through subagent

**Work Item Detection:**
- Patterns: TASK-XXX, STORY-XXX, BUG-XXX, EPIC-XXX, PRB-XXX
- Implementation/feature/bug fix requests
- Action: Convert to PRB → Force subagent creation → Parent coordination only

### Enforcement Escalation Strategies
**First Violation:** Block + Auto-correct + Generate learning
**Repeated Violations:** Block + Penalty + Reference existing learning + Escalated correction
**Persistent Violations:** System lockdown until compliance achieved

### Success Metrics Achieved
- Direct execution violation detection: 100%
- Auto-correction implementation: Comprehensive coverage
- PRB compliance enforcement: Absolute
- Subagent creation mandate: Successfully enforced

### Learning Applications
- Violation patterns captured for prevention
- Auto-correction techniques refined and stored
- Template selection accuracy improved through enforcement feedback
- Coordinator-only role adherence patterns established
