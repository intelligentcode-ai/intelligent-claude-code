# Role Assignment Process Learnings

## 2025-08-03: Fixed Role Assignment Without PM+Architect Collaboration
**Context:** PRB-2025-08-03-020
**Problem:** Roles were being assigned directly without mandatory PM+Architect collaboration
**Solution:** Implemented mandatory collaboration process with blocking mechanisms

### Implementation Details:
1. **Story Breakdown Enhancement**: Added explicit role assignment process requiring PM+Architect collaboration
2. **PRB Creation Mandates**: Added blocking mechanisms for direct role assignments 
3. **Role Management Rules**: Implemented assignment trigger detection and validation requirements

### Key Components:
- **Mandatory Process**: PM analyzes → Selects architect → Joint evaluation → Document rationale
- **Blocking Mechanisms**: Intercept direct @Role mentions and redirect to collaboration
- **Validation Requirements**: PRBs must include assignment rationale and capability match (>70%)
- **Architect Selection**: Domain-specific architects (@AI-Engineer, @System-Engineer, etc.)

### Code Changes:
- `src/behaviors/story-breakdown.md`: Added role assignment process section
- `src/behaviors/prb-creation-mandates.md`: Added role assignment enforcement rules
- `src/behaviors/role-management.md`: Added assignment rules with blocking mechanisms

### Prevention Steps:
1. Always trigger PM analysis first for any role assignment
2. Require architect domain expert collaboration
3. Document collaboration rationale in every PRB
4. Validate capability match scores (>70%) with justification
5. Block execution until proper collaboration documented
