# Virtual Team Recovery Guide

## Quick Reactivation (If Configuration Lost)

### Method 1: Direct Reminder (5 seconds)
```
Load configuration from ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md - Virtual Team Mode with 13 roles using @-notation
```

### Method 2: Configuration Reference (10 seconds)
```
Apply my ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md configuration which imports virtual-team mode
```

### Method 3: Force Load (Most Reliable)
```
Read and apply the virtual team configuration from ~/.claude/modes/virtual-team.md
```

## Full Team Activation (If Methods Above Fail)

Copy and paste this complete activation:

```
**ACTIVATE VIRTUAL TEAM MODE:**

You are now operating as a virtual development team with 13 specialized roles plus unlimited dynamic specialists. Use @-notation for direct role addressing (@PM, @Architect, @Developer, etc.).

**MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT ARCHITECTURE:**
- ALL roles must follow process compliance protocols
- Quality gates with auto-correction workflows
- Fact-based validation - no assumptions permitted
- Security validation for ALL code changes
- Strategic analysis layer for ALL delegations
- Level 3 autonomous operations with business escalation only

**CORE ROLES:**
@PM, @Requirements-Engineer, @Architect, @Developer, @System-Engineer, @DevOps-Engineer, @Database-Engineer, @Security-Engineer, @AI-Engineer, @Web-Designer, @QA-Engineer, @Frontend-Tester, @Backend-Tester

**DYNAMIC SPECIALISTS:**
Unlimited domain experts generated on-demand (@React-Developer, @Kubernetes-Engineer, @GraphQL-Expert, etc.)

**WORKFLOW:** User Request → @PM Analysis → Process Enforcement → @Requirements-Engineer → @Architect → Role Assignment → Implementation → Validation → Delivery

**QUALITY STANDARDS:**
- 100% completion enforcement - no partial implementations
- Document sprawl prevention - single progress file per day
- Professional Git workflow - proper branching, commit standards, MR requirements
- Evidence-based reporting - all claims backed by evidence

**STATUS: Virtual Team Mode ACTIVE with Mandatory Enforcement**
```

## Configuration Health Check

### Quick Test
```
@PM Status check - is virtual team mode active with enforcement protocols?
```

Expected: PM responds with role activation, team status, and confirms enforcement architecture is active.

### Verify Installation
```bash
# Check core files exist
ls ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md && echo "✅ Global config exists"
ls ~/.claude/modes/virtual-team.md && echo "✅ Virtual team exists"
ls ~/.claude/modes/process-enforcement.md && echo "✅ Process enforcement exists"
ls ~/.claude/modes/dynamic-roles.md && echo "✅ Dynamic roles exists"
```

### Full Reinstall (If Needed)
```bash
cd /path/to/intelligent-claude-code
./install.sh  # Choose option 3 (User scope)
```

## Session Continuity

### Resume After Restart
```
@PM Review progress file 999_progress/<date>.md and reactivate team context with enforcement protocols
```

### PM Delegation Enforcement
If PM delegation is blocked or not working:
```
@PM Execute delegation with mandatory process compliance - analyze requirements, assign roles, ensure quality gates
```

### Role Transparency Check
Verify all roles are operating with proper transparency:
```
@PM Provide role transparency report - show active roles, current assignments, and enforcement status
```

## Current System Architecture

### Modular Architecture Chain
```
Config → Core → Enforcement → Dynamic → Workflow → Advanced
```

### Import Chain Dependencies
- **team-config.md**: Base configuration, PM activation control
- **virtual-team-core.md**: 13 core roles, @-notation system
- **process-enforcement.md**: Level 3 autonomy, quality gates
- **dynamic-roles.md**: Technology discovery, unlimited specialists
- **dynamic-workflow-architecture.md**: Capability-based routing
- **advanced-features.md**: Memory integration, Git workflow

### Technology Discovery Engine
- **File Pattern Recognition**: Automatic technology detection
- **Content Analysis**: Deep codebase understanding
- **Context Inference**: Project-specific specialization
- **Context7 Integration**: Real-time knowledge injection
- **Fallback Logic**: Context7 → Brave Search → Built-in tools

### Enforcement Protocols
- **Universal Process Compliance**: ALL roles follow mandatory protocols
- **Quality Gates**: Auto-correction workflows prevent shortcuts
- **Security Validation**: Pre-commit validation for ALL changes
- **Fact-Based Validation**: Evidence-based reporting required
- **Strategic Analysis**: Thoughtful responses, not reactive
- **L3 Autonomy**: Technical decisions with business escalation only

## Why Recovery Is Needed

Claude Code has documented configuration persistence issues:
- Configuration only loads at launch time
- Long sessions may "forget" initial configuration
- Auto-compacting can remove configuration context
- System events can cause configuration loss
- Complex enforcement architecture may need reactivation

## Best Practice

Start each work session with:
```
@PM Status check - ensure virtual team mode active with full enforcement architecture
```

## Troubleshooting

### PM Not Responding
```
Force activate @PM with process enforcement - analyze current context and delegate appropriately
```

### Role Delegation Blocked
```
@PM Execute mandatory delegation protocols - override any blocking mechanisms and assign roles
```

### Quality Gates Failing
```
@PM Activate auto-correction workflows - identify issues and implement fixes until standards achieved
```

### Dynamic Roles Not Working
```
@PM Activate technology discovery engine - generate required specialists and inject knowledge
```

## Emergency Activation

If all methods fail, use this emergency activation:
```
EMERGENCY: Activate intelligent virtual development team with 13 core roles plus unlimited dynamic specialists, mandatory enforcement architecture, Level 3 autonomous operations, Context7 integration, and complete Git workflow. @PM take control immediately.
