### 4. [Troubleshooting Guide](./validation-troubleshooting.md)
**For: Resolving issues**

Step-by-step solutions for common problems:
- Wrong role assignments
- Validation not running
- Specialist creation issues
- Performance problems
- System recovery procedures

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

1. **Make a request** - The system automatically detects work type
2. **Role assigned** - Optimal role selected based on requirements  
3. **Validation runs** - Capability match calculated
4. **Optimization** - Specialist created if needed (<70% match)

### Example Flow

```
User: "Create a React component with Redux integration"

System:
- Detects: Frontend work with React/Redux
- Assigns: @Frontend-Developer
- Validates: 95% capability match
- Result: Optimal assignment confirmed
```

### Manual Validation

Force validation at any time:
```bash
/validate-assignment
```

## Key Concepts

### Work Type Detection
The system automatically identifies:
- **Frontend**: UI, React, Vue, CSS work
- **Backend**: APIs, servers, databases
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, K8s, deployments
- **Security**: Auth, encryption, compliance

### Capability Matching
- **90-100%**: Perfect match, proceed immediately
- **70-89%**: Good match, acceptable assignment
- **50-69%**: Suboptimal, consider specialist
- **<50%**: Poor match, specialist required

### Specialist Creation
When capability match is below 70%:
1. System creates specialized role
2. Injects domain expertise via Context7
3. Assigns specialist to task
4. Ensures optimal expertise

### Multi-Role Coordination
Complex tasks may require multiple specialists:
- Parallel execution for efficiency
- Clear interface definitions
- PM coordination for integration

## Common Commands

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Basic validation
/validate-assignment

# Force revalidation
/validate-assignment --force

# Verbose output
/validate-assignment --verbose

# Check specific role
/validate-assignment @Frontend-Developer
```

### System Commands
```bash
# Check validation status
@PM Show validation system status

# View recent validations
@PM Show validation history

# Reset validation state
/reset --validation-only
```

## Best Practices

### For Optimal Role Assignment

1. **Be Specific**
   ```
   Good: "Create React component with TypeScript"
   Better: "Create React 18 component with TypeScript and Material-UI"
   ```

2. **Include Context**
   ```
   "Fix the API bug" → "Fix the Node.js REST API authentication bug"
   ```

3. **Mention Technologies**
   ```
   "Build chat" → "Build real-time chat with Socket.io and React"
   ```

### For Complex Tasks

1. **Break Down Requirements**
   - Separate frontend and backend work
   - Identify security requirements
   - Note performance needs

2. **Allow Parallel Execution**
   - Let multiple specialists work together
   - Trust PM coordination
   - Define clear interfaces

3. **Trust the Process**
   - Let validation optimize
   - Accept specialist creation
   - Monitor results

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue | Quick Fix | Details |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Wrong role assigned | `/validate-assignment --force` | See [Troubleshooting](./validation-troubleshooting.md#wrong-role-type-assigned) |
| No specialist created | Lower threshold or be more specific | See [Troubleshooting](./validation-troubleshooting.md#specialist-not-created) |
| Validation not running | `/refresh` and reinitialize | See [Troubleshooting](./validation-troubleshooting.md#validation-not-running) |
| Roles working sequentially | `/parallel-delegate --force` | See [Troubleshooting](./validation-troubleshooting.md#roles-not-working-in-parallel) |
