# AI-Agentic Archival System Architecture

## Overview

The AI-Agentic Archival System (STORY-010) provides intelligent, command-driven archival of completed work items to maintain a clean workspace. The system uses behavioral patterns to detect completed items, validate archival safety, and execute Git-aware file operations when archival commands are executed.

## Core Components

### 1. AI Detection Engine
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects completed bugs/stories (status: COMPLETED, phase: ARCHIVED)
- **Task Detection**: Identifies completed tasks within items
- **Manual Scanning**: Analyzes items when archival command is executed
- **Confidence Scoring**: Validates archival eligibility with safety checks

### 2. Archival Decision Engine
- **Intelligent Routing**: Completed tasks → archives/tasks/ (OUT of git)
- **Git-Aware Storage**: Completed bugs/stories → archives/completed/ (IN git)
- **Safety Validation**: Checks dependencies, references, and age requirements
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles manual changes and git conflicts gracefully

### 3. Git Operations Handler
- **Smart Git Management**: Uses `git mv` for tracked files
- **Filesystem Operations**: Direct moves for untracked items
- **Gitignore Updates**: Automatically manages .gitignore patterns
- **Commit Automation**: Creates meaningful archival commits

### 4. Behavioral Enforcement
- **Manual Validation**: Validates items during command execution
- **Learning Patterns**: Captures successful/failed archival patterns
- **User Preferences**: Learns and adapts to team preferences
- **Archive Protection**: Archived items remain in read-only archives

## Command Interface

### Primary Command: `icc:archive-completed`

```bash
# Manual mode - scan and archive all eligible items
icc:archive-completed

# Preview mode - see what would be archived
icc:archive-completed --dry-run

# Specific item - archive specific item
icc:archive-completed --item STORY-001

# Restore mode - bring back from archive
icc:restore-archived TASK-002
```

### PM Commands

```bash
# Execute archival
@PM archive

# Check archival status
@PM archive-status

# Restore specific item
@PM restore TASK-001
```

## Archive Structure

### Git-Tracked Archives (Bugs/Stories/Milestones)
```
archives/
└── completed/
    ├── stories/
    │   └── 2024/
    │       └── 01/
    │           └── 2024-01-15-STORY-001-user-authentication.md
    ├── bugs/
    │   └── 2024/
    │       └── 01/
    │           └── 2024-01-15-BUG-042-login-fix.md
    └── milestones/
        └── 2024/
            └── milestone-M1-phase-1-delivery.md
```

### Untracked Archives (Tasks)
```
archives/
└── tasks/
    └── 2024/
        └── 01/
            └── STORY-001/
                ├── task-001-implement-login.md
                └── task-002-add-validation.md
```

## Safety Mechanisms

### Archival Prerequisites
1. **Status Check**: Item must be COMPLETED with phase ARCHIVED
2. **Completion Verification**: Item has been properly completed and validated
3. **Dependency Validation**: No active dependencies allowed
4. **Reference Check**: No incoming references from active items
5. **User Lock Check**: No active user locks on files

### Rollback Capability
- Automatic rollback on any failure
- Git history preservation
- File restoration to original locations
- Reference restoration
- Complete audit trail

## Integration Points

### Lean Workflow Executor
- Task completion allows archival eligibility
- Phase transitions tracked (especially ARCHIVED)
- Progress updates include archival status
- Manual command-driven execution

### Virtual Team System
- PM role has archive/restore permissions
- DevOps-Engineer handles git conflicts
- System-Engineer manages filesystem operations
- Scoring integration (+0.25P for successful archival)

### Memory System
- Captures archival patterns as entities
- Stores learning from successes/failures
- Maintains relationships between archived items
- Enables pattern-based optimization

## Behavioral Patterns

### Detection Patterns
```pseudocode
completionPatterns = {
    "STORY_COMPLETE": {
        detect: (item) => item.status == "COMPLETED" AND item.phase == "ARCHIVED",
        archivePath: "archives/completed/stories/",
        gitTracked: true
    },
    "TASK_COMPLETE": {
        detect: (task) => task.completed == true OR task.status == "DONE",
        archivePath: "archives/tasks/",
        gitTracked: false
    }
}
```

### Learning Patterns
- First-time success patterns captured
- Failure modes analyzed and prevented
- User preferences learned over time
- Optimization based on historical data

## Configuration

### Default Settings
```yaml
archival_configuration:
  enabled: true
  command_driven: true          # Manual command execution only
  batch_threshold: 10           # Batch operations above this count
  parallel_operations: true     # Enable parallel archival
  git_tracked_types: ["story", "bug", "milestone"]
  untracked_types: ["task"]
```

### Command-Driven Mode
- Manual execution via commands
- User-initiated archival operations
- Non-blocking operations
- Learning and optimization enabled

## Benefits

1. **Clean Workspace**: Helps maintain organized project structure
2. **Git History**: Preserves complete history for tracked items
3. **Easy Retrieval**: Structured archives enable quick restoration
4. **Learning System**: Improves over time based on team patterns
5. **Safety First**: Multiple validation checks prevent accidental loss
6. **Seamless Integration**: Works within existing virtual team workflow

## Usage Examples

### Manual Archival Flow
```
1. Story marked COMPLETED + phase ARCHIVED
2. User executes archival command
3. Archival check runs (dependencies, references)
4. Git mv operation for story file
5. Move associated tasks to archives/tasks/
6. Update references and memory
7. Commit with meaningful message
```

### Specific Item Archival
```
@PM archive --manual STORY-010
- Direct archival of specific item
- Same safety checks apply
- User confirmation required
```

### Restoration
```
@PM restore STORY-010
- Finds item in archives
- Restores to original location
- Updates status to ACTIVE
- Preserves all relationships
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Compression**: Archive old items to save space
2. **Search**: Enhanced archive search capabilities
3. **Reporting**: Archive analytics and insights
4. **Cloud Backup**: Optional cloud archive sync
5. **Retention Policies**: Configurable retention rules
