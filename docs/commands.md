## PM Commands

### Team Management

#### Project Management

#### New Project Creation
```bash
@PM new                      # Auto-detect project type with mandatory configuration
@PM new static my-site       # Create static website project (6 roles)

```

**Mandatory Configuration Process:**
- **Quick Setup (recommended)** - Smart defaults, start building immediately
- **Custom Setup** - Configure all options manually
- Version management strategy selection
- Git workflow enforcement settings  
- Automation preferences (version bump, changelog, releases)
- Team maturity level and collaboration settings
- All settings documented in .claude/project-context.md

#### Project Discovery
```bash
@PM init                     # Intelligent project analysis and configuration
