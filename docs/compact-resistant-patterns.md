# Compact-Resistant Behavioral Patterns

## Overview

This document describes the compact-resistant patterns implemented to maintain behavioral enforcement through Claude Code's AUTO-COMPACT context compression.

## Problem Statement

Claude Code CLI uses AUTO-COMPACT which summarizes/compresses conversations when approaching context limits (200k tokens). This compression loses critical behavioral patterns loaded at initialization, causing:

- PM role violations (executing work instead of coordinating)
- Memory system failures (not checking/storing memory)
- PRB process violations (bypassing structured execution)
- Sequential thinking not applied liberally
- Git workflow violations

## Solution Approach

### 1. COMPACT-RESISTANT Markers

Added to critical enforcement sections to identify content that must survive summarization:

```markdown
## COMPACT-RESISTANT CORE ENFORCEMENT

**ULTRA-SHORT REMINDERS (SURVIVE SUMMARIZATION):**
- **PM=COORDINATION-ONLY** (NO WORK EXECUTION)
- **WORK→PRB→AGENT** (MANDATORY PATTERN)
- **MAIN≠WORK** (Main scope blocks work)
- **TOOLS→AGENTS-ONLY** (Edit/Write/MultiEdit blocked in main)
```

### 2. CHECKPOINT Patterns

Strategic re-injection points for rule reinforcement at decision points:

```markdown
**CHECKPOINT-REMINDER:** PM=COORDINATION-ONLY, WORK→PRB→AGENT, NO-MAIN-EXECUTION
```

### 3. ULTRA-SHORT Reminders

Token-efficient reminders that survive compression:

- **PM=COORDINATION-ONLY**
- **WORK→PRB→AGENT**
- **MAIN≠WORK**
- **TOOLS→AGENTS-ONLY**
- **@ROLE+WORK→IMMEDIATE-PRB**

### 4. Context Monitoring

Detection and response to context compaction:

- Monitor conversation length approaching limits
- Detect weakened enforcement language
- Re-inject critical patterns when needed
- Trigger behavioral reinforcement checkpoints

## Pattern Categories

### Core Enforcement Patterns
- Work execution blocking in main scope
- PM role coordination-only enforcement
- PRB+Agent execution requirements
- Tool access restrictions

### Decision Points
- Work intent detection
- Role assignment logic
- Context complexity evaluation
- Behavioral choice validation

### Monitoring Patterns
- Token limit awareness
- Behavioral violation detection
- Pattern persistence validation
- Automatic reinforcement triggers

## Testing Strategy

Verify patterns survive compaction through extended conversation testing:

1. Initialize system with behavioral patterns
2. Conduct extended conversation (approaching token limits)
3. Verify core enforcement patterns remain active
4. Test PM role coordination enforcement
5. Validate PRB+Agent execution requirements
6. Confirm tool access restrictions maintained

## Benefits

- **Persistent Enforcement**: Core behavioral patterns survive context compression
- **Reliable Operation**: System behavior remains consistent in long conversations
- **Reduced Re-initialization**: Less need for frequent system resets
- **Improved Reliability**: Behavioral violations significantly reduced
- **Compact Efficiency**: Token-efficient pattern representation

## Future Enhancements

- Dynamic pattern reinforcement based on context analysis
- Adaptive checkpoint frequency based on conversation length
- Pattern effectiveness monitoring and optimization
- Automated pattern strength assessment and adjustment
