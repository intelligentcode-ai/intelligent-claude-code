# Memory System Integration

## Overview

The memory system provides persistent knowledge capture and retrieval, enabling the Virtual Team to build accumulated wisdom over time and avoid repeating mistakes.

## Architecture

### Memory-First Culture
The system emphasizes consulting memory before taking actions:
- All command chains start with `/memory-first`
- Past solutions and patterns are retrieved
- Team knowledge is leveraged
- Context is preserved across sessions

### MCP Memory Integration
Uses the MCP Memory provider for:
- **Entity Storage**: Persistent knowledge entities
- **Relationship Tracking**: Connections between concepts
- **Search Capabilities**: Query-based knowledge retrieval
- **Observation Capture**: Detailed implementation notes

## Memory Types

### Technical Patterns
```javascript
{
  name: "AuthenticationPattern",
  entityType: "TechnicalPattern",
  observations: [
    "JWT tokens with 15-minute expiration",
    "Refresh token rotation every 7 days",
    "Rate limiting: 5 attempts per minute"
  ]
}
```

### Project Knowledge
```javascript
{
  name: "TodoAppProject",
  entityType: "ProjectContext",
  observations: [
    "React frontend with TypeScript",
    "Node.js backend with Express",
    "MongoDB for data persistence"
  ]
}
```

### Team Learning
```javascript
{
  name: "SecurityLesson",
  entityType: "TeamLearning",
  observations: [
    "Always validate input parameters",
    "Use prepared statements for SQL",
    "Implement proper error handling"
  ]
}
```

### Code Solutions
```javascript
{
  name: "ReactComponentPattern",
  entityType: "CodePattern",
  observations: [
    "Use functional components with hooks",
    "Implement proper prop validation",
    "Include error boundaries"
  ]
}
```

## Command Chain Integration

### Memory Consultation
Every command chain begins with memory consultation:

```bash
/memory-first "authentication implementation"
  → Search for: AuthenticationPattern entities
  → Retrieve: Previous implementations
  → Identify: Known issues and solutions
  → Load: Team knowledge and decisions
```

### Result Storage
Every command chain ends with result storage:

```bash
/store-results
  → Create: New entities for patterns
  → Update: Existing entities with new observations
  → Link: Related entities together
  → Capture: Implementation details
```

## Memory Usage Patterns

### Before Implementation
```bash
@Developer Implement user login
# Developer command chain:
# 1. /memory-first "user authentication"
# 2. Retrieves previous auth patterns
# 3. Identifies security considerations
# 4. Loads implementation templates
```

### During Problem Solving
```bash
@Architect Design API rate limiting
# Architect command chain:
# 1. /memory-first "rate limiting patterns"
# 2. Reviews previous implementations
# 3. Identifies performance considerations
# 4. Loads security requirements
```

### After Completion
```bash
# All roles automatically:
# 1. Store implementation patterns
# 2. Capture lessons learned
# 3. Document issue resolutions
# 4. Build team knowledge base
```

"MongoDB connection pooling"
```

### Contextual Searches
```bash
# Search for related concepts
