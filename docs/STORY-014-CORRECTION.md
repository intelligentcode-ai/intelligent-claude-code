# STORY-014 Implementation Correction

## Summary

STORY-014 was fundamentally misunderstood during implementation. The tasks incorrectly created a software ID generator system when they should have created behavioral documentation for ID formatting.

## What Went Wrong

The intelligent-claude-code system is a **BEHAVIORAL DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM** for Claude Code. It consists of:
- Markdown files with behavioral guidelines
- Documentation patterns for humans and AI
- Templates and examples
- NO executable code or software systems

However, STORY-014 tasks incorrectly implemented:
- A software ID generator class
- File locking mechanisms
- Counter persistence files
- Pseudo-code that looked like actual code

## What Has Been Corrected

### 1. Replaced ID Generator with Documentation
- **Removed**: `src/behaviors/id-generator.md` (software implementation)
- **Created**: `src/behaviors/id-formatting-guide.md` (behavioral documentation)

### 2. Updated Command Files
All create commands now reference the formatting guide instead of a generator:
- `/icc-create-epic`
- `/icc-create-story`
- `/icc-create-bug`

Each command now shows manual ID assignment following the guidelines.

### 3. Created Templates
Added template files showing proper ID usage:
- `templates/epic-template.yaml`
- `templates/story-template.yaml`
- `templates/bug-template.yaml`

### 4. Updated Tests
- **Renamed**: `test/test-id-generator.md` â†’ `test/test-id-formatting.md`
- Now contains format validation examples, not software tests

## Correct ID Assignment Process

The system now documents a simple manual process:

1. **Check existing IDs**: Look at the highest existing ID for that type
2. **Increment by one**: Use the next sequential number
3. **Format properly**: TYPE-XXX (e.g., EPIC-001, STORY-015, BUG-068)

## Key Learnings

1. **System Nature**: This is behavioral documentation, not software
2. **Documentation Focus**: Guidelines and examples, not code
3. **Manual Processes**: Simple manual ID assignment, not automation
4. **Templates Over Code**: Templates demonstrate usage better than pseudo-code

## Status

- STORY-014 remains marked as COMPLETED
- TASK-002 and TASK-003 have correction notices
- All implementation files have been corrected
- System now properly reflects its documentation nature

## Future Guidelines

When working on intelligent-claude-code:
- Remember it's BEHAVIORAL DOCUMENTATION
- Create guidelines, not software
- Write templates and examples
- Avoid code-like implementations
- Focus on human/AI guidance
