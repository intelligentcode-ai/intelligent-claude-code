# Quick Start Tutorial

## Overview

This tutorial walks you through your first experience with the Virtual Team system, demonstrating command chain coordination and role specialization.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Virtual Team system installed (see [Installation Guide](installation.md))
- Basic understanding of @-notation

## Tutorial: Building a Simple Todo App

### Step 1: Initialize Project Management

```bash
@PM Build me a simple todo application
```

**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. PM executes command chain:
   - `/memory-first` - Checks for similar projects
   - `/think-strategic` - Analyzes requirements
   - `/parallel-delegate` - Creates tasks for different roles
   - `/track-progress` - Sets up monitoring

**Expected output:**
- PM analysis of requirements
- Task breakdown across multiple roles
- Progress tracking setup
- Initial team coordination

### Step 2: Observe Role Specialization

The PM will typically delegate to:
- **@Architect** - Application structure design
- **@Developer** - Implementation tasks
- **@QA-Engineer** - Testing strategy
- **@User-Role** - User experience validation

**What to notice:**
- Each role follows its own command chain
- Roles work with shared context from memory
- Progress is tracked in real-time
- Quality validation happens automatically

### Step 3: Review Team Coordination

Watch how roles coordinate:
```bash
@PM Show current progress
```

**Expected to see:**
- Task status updates
- Role-specific contributions
- Team coordination patterns
- Quality gate validations

### Step 4: Interact with Specific Roles

Try direct role communication:
```bash
@Architect Show me the application architecture
@Developer What technologies are you using?
@QA-Engineer What's your testing strategy?
```

**Command chains in action:**
- Each role consults memory first
- Strategic thinking patterns applied
- Specialist knowledge demonstrated
- Quality validation embedded

### Step 5: Monitor Learning and Scoring

```bash
@PM Show team scores
@PM What have we learned so far?
```

**Observe:**
- Professionalism and Quality scores
- Learning insights generated
- Team performance patterns
- Memory capture working

## Understanding Command Chains

### What You Don't See
Command chains execute internally - you don't see:
- `/memory-first` consultations
- `/think-strategic` analysis
- `/quality-gates` validation
- `/store-results` actions

### What You Do See
The results of command chain execution:
- Consistent role behavior
- Memory-informed responses
- Quality-validated deliverables
- Learning insights captured

## Common Patterns

### Project Initiation
```bash
@PM Start a new [project type]
# PM command chain coordinates entire team
```

### Technical Decisions
```bash
@Architect Design the [component]
# Architect command chain includes security validation
```

### Implementation Work
```bash
@Developer Implement [feature]
# Developer command chain includes quality validation
```

### Quality Assurance
```bash
@QA-Engineer Test [component]
# QA command chain includes comprehensive validation
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Command Chains Not Working
**Symptoms**: Roles not following expected patterns
**Solutions**:
- Use consistent @-notation
- Provide clear, specific requests
- Allow time for command chain execution
- Check team scores for patterns

### Memory Not Consulted
**Symptoms**: Roles missing previous context
**Solutions**:
- Explicitly mention memory consultation
- Use consistent entity names
- Review memory organization
- Provide feedback on memory gaps

### Quality Varies
**Symptoms**: Inconsistent output quality
**Solutions**:
- Use specific requirements
- Provide feedback on deliverables
- Review scoring patterns
- Build team knowledge gradually

## Advanced Features

### Parallel Task Execution
```bash
@PM Build a user authentication system with tests and documentation
# PM creates parallel tasks for multiple roles
```

### Dynamic Role Specialization
```bash
@PM I need help with React components
# May generate @React-Developer with specialized knowledge
```

### Memory-Driven Decisions
```bash
@PM How did we handle user authentication last time?
# PM consults memory for previous patterns
```

## Best Practices

### For New Users
1. Start with simple, clear requests
2. Use @PM for project-level coordination
3. Observe command chain execution patterns
4. Review scores and learning regularly

### For Specific Needs
1. Use specialized roles (@Architect, @Developer, @QA-Engineer)
2. Provide context and requirements
3. Allow command chains to execute fully
4. Build on previous work through memory

### For Complex Projects
1. Let PM coordinate multiple roles
2. Use parallel task delegation
3. Monitor progress and quality
4. Provide feedback for improvement

## What to Expect

### Immediate Benefits
- Structured approach to AI assistance
- Consistent role behavior patterns
- Memory-informed responses
- Quality validation embedded

### Long-term Benefits
- Accumulated team knowledge
- Improved coordination patterns
- Better quality consistency
- Enhanced learning capture

### Realistic Expectations
- This is a behavioral framework, not enforcement
- Quality improves with usage and feedback
- Command chains guide behavior, don't guarantee it
- Memory and learning build over time

## Next Steps

1. **Read** [Command Chain Guide](command-chains.md)
2. **Explore** [Virtual Team Roles](features/virtual-team.md)
3. **Understand** [Limitations](limitations.md)
4. **Practice** with real projects
5. **Provide** feedback for improvement

## Getting Help

### If Things Don't Work
1. Check your @-notation usage
2. Review [Limitations](limitations.md)
3. Provide specific feedback
4. Be patient - system learns over time

### Common Questions
- **Q**: Why aren't command chains executing?
  **A**: Command chains are behavioral guidance, not automated execution
- **Q**: How do I know if memory is working?
  **A**: Ask roles to reference previous work
- **Q**: What if quality is inconsistent?
  **A**: Provide feedback and build team knowledge gradually

## Conclusion

The Virtual Team system provides structured AI assistance through command chain coordination and role specialization. Success comes from understanding it's a behavioral framework designed to organize and improve AI collaboration over time.

Key takeaways:
- Use @-notation consistently
- Allow command chains to work internally
- Build team knowledge through usage
- Provide feedback for improvement
- Set realistic expectations for a behavioral framework
