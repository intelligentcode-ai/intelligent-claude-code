# Quick Start Tutorial

## Overview

This tutorial walks you through your first experience with the Virtual Team system, demonstrating streamlined behavioral intelligence and role coordination through natural @-role interaction.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- Virtual Team system installed (see [Installation Guide](installation.md))
- Basic understanding of @-notation

## Tutorial: Building a Simple Todo App

### Step 0: System Initialization (First Time)

```bash
/init    # Validates team configuration and activates all systems
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Verifies configuration files properly installed
- ✅ Activates all 14 core team roles
- ✅ Validates memory system and tool integrations
- ✅ Reports system readiness status

### Step 1: Initialize Project Management

```bash
@PM Build me a simple todo application
```

**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. Runtime Execution behavior activates PM role
2. PM Command Chain executes automatically:
   - Memory consultation - Checks for similar projects
   - Strategic thinking - Analyzes requirements
   - Parallel delegation - Creates tasks for different roles
   - Progress tracking - Sets up monitoring

**Expected output:**
- PM analysis of requirements
- Task breakdown across multiple roles
- Progress tracking setup
- Initial team coordination

### Step 2: Observe Role Specialization

The PM will typically delegate to:
- **@Architect** - Application structure design
- **@Developer** - Implementation tasks
- **@QA-Engineer** - Testing strategy
- **@User-Role** - User experience validation

**What to notice:**
- Each role follows the streamlined behavioral intelligence pattern
- Runtime Execution provides automatic coordination
- Command Chains ensure consistent role behavior
- Quality validation happens transparently

### Step 3: Review Team Coordination

Watch how roles coordinate:
```bash
@PM Show current progress
```

**Expected to see:**
- Task status updates
- Role-specific contributions
- Team coordination patterns
- Quality gate validations

### Step 4: Interact with Specific Roles

Try direct role communication:
```bash
@Architect Show me the application architecture
@Developer What technologies are you using?
@QA-Engineer What's your testing strategy?
```

**Behavioral intelligence in action:**
- Runtime Execution activates appropriate role expertise
- Command Chains ensure memory consultation and strategic thinking
- Specialist knowledge delivered naturally
- Quality validation happens automatically

### Step 5: Monitor Learning and Scoring

```bash
@PM Show team scores
@PM What have we learned so far?
```

**Observe:**
- Professionalism and Quality scores
- Learning insights generated
- Team performance patterns
- Memory capture working

## Understanding Behavioral Intelligence

### What You Don't See
Behavioral intelligence operates transparently - you don't see:
- Runtime Execution activation and role loading
- Command Chain pattern execution
- Memory consultation and strategic thinking
- Quality validation and result storage

### What You Do See
The results of behavioral intelligence:
- Natural role responses with professional quality
- Memory-informed context and solutions
- Consistent behavior across all interactions
- Learning insights and continuous improvement

## Common Patterns

### Project Initiation
```bash
@PM Start a new [project type]
# Runtime Execution + PM Command Chain provide full coordination
```

### Technical Decisions
```bash
@Architect Design the [component]
# Behavioral intelligence ensures security validation and quality
```

### Implementation Work
```bash
@Developer Implement [feature]
# Streamlined behaviors provide memory consultation and validation
```

### Quality Assurance
```bash
@QA-Engineer Test [component]
# Behavioral patterns ensure comprehensive testing approach
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### System Not Responding
**Symptoms**: Team seems inactive or unresponsive
**Solutions**:
```bash
/init     # Initialize system and verify configuration
/reset    # Clear stuck states and restart fresh
/refresh  # Update capabilities and tool integrations
```

### Behavioral Intelligence Not Activating
**Symptoms**: Roles not following expected patterns
**Solutions**:
- Use consistent @-notation for role addressing
- Provide clear, specific requests
- Allow behavioral patterns to execute
- Check team scores for performance patterns
- Try `/reset` if behaviors seem stuck

### Memory Not Consulted
**Symptoms**: Roles missing previous context
**Solutions**:
- Explicitly mention memory consultation
- Use consistent entity names
- Review memory organization
- Provide feedback on memory gaps

### Quality Varies
**Symptoms**: Inconsistent output quality
**Solutions**:
- Use specific requirements
- Provide feedback on deliverables
- Review scoring patterns
- Build team knowledge gradually

## Advanced Features

### Parallel Task Execution
```bash
@PM Build a user authentication system with tests and documentation
# Behavioral intelligence coordinates parallel role execution
```

### Dynamic Role Specialization
```bash
@PM I need help with React components
# Runtime Execution may generate @React-Developer with specialized knowledge
```

### Memory-Driven Decisions
```bash
@PM How did we handle user authentication last time?
# Behavioral patterns automatically consult memory for previous solutions
```

## Best Practices

### For New Users
1. Start with simple, clear requests
2. Use @PM for project-level coordination
3. Observe behavioral intelligence in action
4. Review scores and learning regularly

### For Specific Needs
1. Use specialized roles (@Architect, @Developer, @QA-Engineer)
2. Provide context and requirements
3. Allow behavioral patterns to execute naturally
4. Build on previous work through memory

### For Complex Projects
1. Let PM coordinate multiple roles through behavioral intelligence
2. Trust parallel task coordination
3. Monitor progress and quality outcomes
4. Provide feedback for continuous improvement

## What to Expect

### Immediate Benefits
- Natural @-role interaction with professional outcomes
- Consistent behavioral patterns across all roles
- Memory-informed responses and context awareness
- Quality validation happening transparently

### Long-term Benefits
- Accumulated team knowledge and improved solutions
- Enhanced coordination through streamlined behaviors
- Better quality consistency with reduced complexity
- Continuous learning and pattern recognition

### Realistic Expectations
- Behavioral intelligence operates as guidance framework
- Quality improves with usage and team memory building
- Streamlined behaviors provide consistency, not rigid enforcement
- System learns and adapts through interaction patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Read** [Behavioral Intelligence Guide](behavioral-intelligence.md)
2. **Explore** [Virtual Team Roles](features/virtual-team.md)
3. **Understand** [Limitations](limitations.md)
4. **Practice** with real projects
5. **Provide** feedback for improvement

## Getting Help

### If Things Don't Work
1. Try system commands: `/init`, `/reset`, or `/refresh`
2. Check your @-notation usage
3. Review [Limitations](limitations.md)
4. Provide specific feedback
5. Be patient - system learns over time

### Common Questions
- **Q**: Why isn't behavioral intelligence working as expected?
  **A**: Behavioral intelligence is guidance framework that improves with usage
- **Q**: How do I know if memory is working?
  **A**: Ask roles to reference previous work and observe context awareness
- **Q**: What if quality is inconsistent?
  **A**: Provide feedback and build team knowledge - quality improves over time

## Conclusion

The Virtual Team system provides structured AI assistance through streamlined behavioral intelligence and role specialization. Success comes from understanding it's a guidance framework designed to organize and improve AI collaboration over time.

Key takeaways:
- Use @-notation consistently for role addressing
- Allow behavioral intelligence to operate transparently
- Build team knowledge through usage and interaction
