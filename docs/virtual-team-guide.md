### Dynamic Creation Process

When @PM encounters work requiring specialized knowledge:

1. **Domain Analysis**: @PM identifies the technology or domain requirements
2. **Capability Assessment**: System evaluates existing agent capabilities  
3. **Specialist Creation**: If no agent has >70% capability match, creates new specialist
4. **Knowledge Integration**: New agent inherits relevant patterns and knowledge
5. **Team Integration**: New agent collaborates with existing team members

Example:
```bash
@PM Build a React Native mobile app with Redux state management

# System creates:
# @React-Native-Developer: Mobile development expertise
# @Redux-Architect: State management specialist  
# @Mobile-UI-Designer: Mobile-specific design patterns
# @iOS-Engineer: iOS-specific implementations
# @Android-Engineer: Android-specific implementations
```

## Agent Collaboration Patterns

### PM-Architect Partnership

The foundation of agent collaboration is the @PM and @Architect partnership:

**Strategic Alignment**: 
- @PM focuses on business goals, timelines, and resource coordination
- @Architect focuses on technical approach, system design, and technology decisions
- Together they create coherent project strategy combining business and technical perspectives

**Agent Creation & Assignment**:
- @PM identifies work requirements and business constraints
- @Architect evaluates technical approaches and technology needs
- Together they decide which specialists to create and assign to work
- Joint assignment ensures both business alignment and technical excellence

**Continuous Coordination**:
- @PM tracks progress and adjusts priorities based on business needs
- @Architect monitors technical decisions and guides system evolution
- Both provide input on agent performance and specialization needs

### Cross-Agent Knowledge Sharing

Agents actively share knowledge and learn from each other:

**Implementation Patterns**: @Developer agents share successful code patterns and approaches
**Security Insights**: @Security-Engineer shares vulnerability patterns with all implementation agents  
**Quality Standards**: @QA-Engineer and testing agents share quality expectations and practices
**Architecture Decisions**: @Architect shares design rationale that guides all implementation work
**User Feedback**: @User-Role shares usability insights that improve design and development decisions

### Multi-Agent Work Coordination

Complex work involves multiple agents working together:

**Feature Development**:
1. @PM analyzes business requirements and coordinates overall effort
2. @Architect designs technical approach and guides system integration
3. @Requirements-Engineer creates detailed specifications and acceptance criteria
4. Implementation agents (@Developer, @Frontend-Developer, etc.) build the feature
5. Quality agents (@QA-Engineer, @Backend-Tester, @User-Role) validate deliverables
6. @Security-Engineer reviews security implications
7. @DevOps-Engineer handles deployment and operations concerns

**Bug Resolution**:
1. @QA-Engineer or @Backend-Tester identifies and reports the issue
2. @PM prioritizes based on business impact  
3. @Architect provides guidance if architectural changes needed
4. Appropriate implementation agent fixes the bug
5. Testing agents validate the fix
6. @DevOps-Engineer deploys the fix if needed

## Agent Memory & Learning

### Individual Agent Learning
Each agent maintains specialized knowledge in their domain:
- **@Developer**: Code patterns, debugging techniques, implementation strategies
- **@Security-Engineer**: Vulnerability patterns, security best practices, compliance requirements  
- **@QA-Engineer**: Testing strategies, quality patterns, defect prevention techniques
- **@Architect**: Design patterns, technology decisions, system evolution principles

### Cross-Agent Knowledge Transfer
Agents share relevant knowledge across domains:
- Security insights propagate to all implementation agents
- Quality standards are understood by all agents creating deliverables  
- Architecture decisions guide implementation agent choices
- User experience feedback influences design and development decisions

### Organizational Learning
The agent system as a whole improves over time:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Successful collaboration patterns are identified and reused
- **Process Optimization**: Agent coordination improves based on project outcomes
- **Quality Improvement**: Overall deliverable quality improves through shared learning
- **Efficiency Gains**: Agents become more efficient as they learn optimal work patterns

## Autonomous Operation Levels

### L1 - Manual Approval Mode
- All agent actions require human approval before execution
- Maximum control and oversight of every agent decision
- Best for: Initial setup, highly sensitive projects, learning the system

### L2 - Architect Approval Mode (Default)
- Agent coordination handled by @PM automatically  
- Technical decisions require @Architect approval
- Implementation work proceeds autonomously after approval
- Best for: Most projects, balanced control and efficiency

### L3 - Full Autonomous Mode
- Agents work completely independently with minimal human intervention
- @PM coordinates all work and makes autonomous decisions
- Agents create specialists, execute work, and resolve issues independently
- Human approval only required for destructive operations, credentials, production deploys
- Best for: Mature projects, experienced teams, maximum efficiency

### Configuring Autonomy
```yaml
# In CLAUDE.md
autonomy_level: L2                   # L1, L2, or L3
l3_settings:                        # Only used in L3 mode
  max_parallel: 5                   # Maximum concurrent agents
  auto_discover: true               # Agents find work automatically  
  continue_on_error: true           # Self-correction without stopping
```

## Best Practices for Agent Teams

### Effective Agent Communication
- Use clear @Agent syntax: `@PM Build authentication system`
- Be specific about requirements and constraints
- Let @PM coordinate multi-agent work rather than directing individual agents
- Trust agents to create appropriate specialists for technology domains

### Project Organization
- Write clear user stories in `stories/` directory for @PM to analyze
- Maintain comprehensive `CLAUDE.md` configuration for agent guidance
- Organize work hierarchically: Epics → Stories → PRBs → Agent execution
- Let agents handle technical breakdown and implementation details

### Quality Assurance  
- Trust the agent quality system (@QA-Engineer, @Backend-Tester, @User-Role coordination)
- Let @Security-Engineer review security implications across all work
- Use agent memory to avoid repeating resolved issues
- Leverage cross-agent learning for continuous improvement

### Memory Management
- Use external memory configuration for cross-project agent learning
- Let agents store and retrieve learnings automatically
- Share agent memory across team members for collaborative improvement
- Regularly review agent learnings for insights into system and process improvements

## Getting Started with Your Agent Team

### 1. Initialize the System
```bash  
/icc-init-system
```

### 2. Start with @PM  
```bash
@PM Build a [project description]
```

### 3. Let Agent Collaboration Unfold
- @PM will analyze requirements and create appropriate specialists
- Agent team will coordinate technical approach and implementation
- Quality agents will validate deliverables throughout the process  
- All agents will learn and improve from the experience

### 4. Adjust Configuration as Needed
- Start with L2 autonomy and adjust based on comfort and project needs
- Configure memory paths for optimal learning and knowledge sharing
- Adjust agent behavior through `CLAUDE.md` project configuration
